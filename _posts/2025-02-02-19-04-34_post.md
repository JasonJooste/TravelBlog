Hi BoBbers,

In mid-October, with a heavy heart, I left Alice and the gang after a long rest in Morvan.
I was pretty undecided, but in the end I settled on Barcelona as the next destination, a route almost entirely through the diagonal du vide, "the empty diagonal", the least dense region of france. Luckily, I had met the lovely Marie, a friend of Alice's. This led me on a tour of friends and friends-of-friends, little oases of company in a desert of long rides and superficial communication with my very dusty french.

I did some impressive bush mechanics on a broken tent pole and rear hub, was hit on twice by middle aged men completely out of nowhere, crossed the epic Pas de Peyrol without any food and managed to get food poisoning so bad that I lay next to the road in the sun for three hours in my full kit including rain gear, until my next host drove 30km to pick me up. I also spent a surprisingly-okay night in an abandoned building *on halloween night*.
My time in France ended with a two-day ride from Toulouse to Puigcerda, near Andorra, high up in the Pyranees and my first stop in Spain.

J&BoB
