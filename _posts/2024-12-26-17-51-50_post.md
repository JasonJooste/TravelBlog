Infused with the power of 1000 German apples, I cruised through magnificent countryside on some great bike paths to see my cousins in western Switzerland - my first stop. I was very nervous but my friend Alex shared my first day with me and helped me with some advice about nutrition and the very gentle suggestion that carrying 3kgs of apples and some Czech crowns might not be optimal. My very cheap brake pads ruptured through the rubber and carved a groove into my rim, but BoB was still moving so life was good. Also, who knew that cemeteries would be the best place to get drinking water?
