Hi BoBbers,

We moved from Essaouira, a somewhat sleepy seaside town to Marrakech, a place which maybe naps for 15 minutes between day and night shift at the camel ride factory. The biggest difference between the two city centres is the traffic. In all other cities I visited, the medina is a walking-only network of narrow, dark and cool alleys. In Marrakesh, these alleys are filled with scooters and even cars. This makes the already crowded space oppressive with noise and smoke.

I've never been great with lots of hustle and bustle so honestly it's been a little overwhelming for me. We're also paying significantly more for basically everything here. After taking a photo of a group playing music from at least 10 metres away, a man with a sixth sense for photographers magically appeared next to me holding out a tamborine for a tip. It's hard not to feel like we're getting ripped off. Tomorrow I'm off to hike around Toubkal mountain and Alice is heading back to Agadir to fly home after almost exactly 3 months together :(

Soon to be just

J&BoB
