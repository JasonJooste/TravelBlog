    ,"content"  : "Hi BoBers, I left Lagos in the late afternoon, keen to put even a little distance between myself and its insanity. I quickly regretted it when I found myself on an empty highway at sunset with nowhere to stay. Even after more than a year in Africa, the talk of bandits, robberies and kidnappings made me nervous. Usually, people claim the neighbouring countries are dangerous and insist theirs is different. In Nigeria, for the first time, their nationalism is always followed by a “but…”. As always, my nervousness was overblown. I found a church in a small village and stayed the night. In the morning, the pastor brought bread and chocolate milk for dipping. “Tea and bread” - a Nigerian staple. Later that day I broke a spoke. Godwin and his son gave me replacements for free. Nigerians are direct, in their requests and their kindness. I have never had so many people offer small gifts along the way. At times the attention felt oppressive. Nigeria was a good lesson in saying no. The riding was tough. There is no decent road through to Abuja, so I cut across the countryside. It was lush and beautiful, but oppressively hot and humid, and the roads were dreadful. Conscious of my short visa, I rode long, sweaty days with little progress. I developed a sweat rash and BoB had his own collection of maladies. Even in the countryside I passed countless checkpoints: army, vehicle inspection, police, forestry, even the navy, hundreds of kilometres from the coast. Local communities set up ad hoc checkpoints to shake down visitors. Essentially rent seeking, people said it was for the community. While taking it from other communities, of course. Luckily, as a sweaty white man on a bicycle, I was a spectacle and spared the extortion, even though I could better afford it than most. I also passed many churches and mosques, growing grander as the people grew poorer. Economically, such splendour built on the backs of the poorest on earth is a scandal. Psychologically, it makes sense. The poorer and more uncertain your life, the more religion offers a sense of control. Towards the end of my journey I stayed with Simeon, an engineer with a master’s degree getting by as a contractor. When he was younger he scraped together money for a visa and flight to Europe. On arrival he discovered the visa was fake and was sent straight home, broke. He and many others told me that without connections, work is hard to find in Nigeria. For a good government job you often have to pay a bribe of many thousands of dollars, and sometimes still do not get it. He rented a small room in a family home. The landlord’s fourteen year old daughter had recently used a spare key to steal cash and building supplies from his room. I saw him in deep discussion with local police and church elders. He wanted justice, but not for her to be burned with hot irons or beaten. He did not want her arrested either, as she was the sole carer for her bedridden mother. Despite all this, he was glad to host me for the night. It is not easy in Nigeria. People say that often. I had taken a detour to the National Museum in Esie, the first in Nigeria, where thousands of intricate soapstone figures were discovered centuries ago beneath some trees. The museum and local schools were closed due to the threat of kidnapping. The guard was alarmed by my bicycle helmet, mistaking it for a combat helmet. Once he realised I was a tourist, he called his boss, who gave me a free personal tour. I think he was glad to have something to do. After many conversations about the safest route, I nervously set off for the capital, Abuja. On our toes, J&amp;BoB"

    ,"content"  : "Hi BoBers, Lagos is an enormous, sprawling city of 20 million people, the second largest in Africa. Everything here is done en masse. Cars. People. Animals. Buildings. All of it crammed into every nook and cranny. As with many places of such density, scams are rampant. I ordered doughnuts and watched as the final one “accidentally” missed the bag and fell back onto the pile. I bought a month’s data and got a day. When I argued, she said she bought it for a week. Prices varied wildly based on how vulnerable I looked to the seller. I quickly became less trustful and tougher, not a particularly natural or enjoyable role for me. In contrast, some areas of the city are stomach-turningly rich. Rows of luxury apartment blocks with jetties and speedboats on the river. Luxury clubs with infinity pools. All in plain sight of those sleeping on the streets. I took a taxi that evening to meet a local friend-of-a-friend. The driver spoke rapturously of “dirty December”, when the Nigerian diaspora returns to Lagos to flex their foreign earnings. Like the cliché in the USA, I think he saw himself as a temporarily embarrassed millionaire, trying to win the game rather than change it. At the rooftop bar, beers were 7,000 naira. At a regular bar, they’re 1,200. It’s like paying fifty dollars for a Heineken in Australia. Absurd. The cheapest hotel I could find was a “luxury” place (sorry for all the quotes, I’m feeling particularly sarcastic today), a microcosm of the surrounding city. My room looked out over the slums that encircled the hotel. The hot water didn’t work, but they called me sir while apologising. The breakfast was meagre, but was served by staff in crisp white shirts and bowties. Of course, there was also a pool and fitness studio. One haven in the chaos is the Niké Art Gallery, absolutely stuffed with paintings and sculptures. I felt like I understood Nigeria better after seeing it through the eyes of a thousand artists. The effusive and theatrical Niké welcomed me and immediately dubbed me “the bicycle man”, introducing me as such to the gallery’s many guests, partly because I’m sure she forgot my name in the hubbub. I felt like a minor celebrity, but also like an object. Taking selfies, striking the requested pose, then being ignored the moment the photo was taken. I was just another flex. Later, Niké gave me a fan with her face on it and kindly offered for me to stay in her daughter’s apartment, still under construction, which I gladly accepted to avoid another night at the hotel. I was glad to leave the city the next day, completely overwhelmed by its mess of activity and contradictions. Classily divided, J&amp;BoB"

    ,"content"  : "Hi BoBers, I passed broken down vans, verdant golf courses and people bathing in rivers on the immaculate new coastal road from Ouidah to Cotonou. That night, we went to a wine-and-cheese night hosted by a French expat in an apartment looking over this pristine waterfront. A far cry from sweating on the floor in Ouidah. Is it right to move so seamlessly between two worlds? Then I got sick. Probably COVID. Luckily, I’d found a relatively cheap hotel with western food so I rested in comfort, extending my stay a few times. Once I realised that I also had malaria, I took the medication and recovered quickly. BoB and I were back on the road to Nigeria after this week of enforced rest, a little weak but good spirits. I stopped by the capital Porto Novo and ended up drinking with some fisherman into the evening. As I followed two guys from the side of the road to a cheap hotel, a little drunk, it hit me how far I’d come from the trip’s first nervous steps. I realise that this might seem silly or reckless to some, but all I can say is that many months on the road fills you with an overwhelming certainty that things will be okay, a tolerance for discomfort and an excellent radar for bullshit in which I have full confidence. The next day, the roads to the border were lined with stalls selling cheap fuel smuggled across the border. At one of the stalls, I met a fellow cyclist from Ghana with an absolutely tricked-out bike including inbuilt subwoofer. A true engineer. Thankfully, I crossed the border without any problems. On the road I met Tunde, who paid for a hotel for me. The first of many acts of generosity here. On the way into the city the next day, I met a ton of people. Many asking for money or selfies, but others with no agenda. Susan has four kids, just got divorced and is very proud of the store that she’s running to support her family. Princess, selling routers, hit on me ruthlessly. White guys are definitely seen as a way to escape Nigeria. Promise tried to scam me while I was buying data. You’ve got to be on your toes here. Lagos itself is pure chaos. The most populous city in the most populous country of Africa, there it just too much of everything at all times. Too many cars and motorbikes. Too much rubbish. Too many people. Too much noise. Entering the city, I passed a guy striding down the centre of the road, probably high, with an empty gaze, holding up traffic. I guided him off the road, breaking him from his single-minded focus and he collapsed, immediately unconscious. As I was rolling him onto his side, people yelled at me from all directions to leave him. That it was his fault. That he deserved it. This small act of kindness enough to make them uncomfortable. The other side of Nigeria. I found a too-expensive hotel - nobody had answered my couchsurfing request in this city of 20 million, a first in Africa. Definitely a place of contrasts.

    ,"content"  : "Hi BoBers, Vodun is an animist religion in West Africa and the origin of the Voodoo traditions of the Caribbean and mainland America. It is celebrated every year on the 10th of January in Benin, where it is practiced by most people alongside Islam or Christianity. Lately, the festival has grown in popularity, partly due to massive investment by the current president and autocratic leader Patrice Talon, perhaps in an attempt to launder the country’s reputation a little after the coup attempt in late 2025. The emphasis was very much on Vodun as holistic religion, emphasising its focus on peace and connection with nature, probably to counteract foreigner’s (and my own) ignorant association of voodoo with bloody sacrifice. I saw some impromptu sacrifices on the street by residents during the celebrations, but they were very much not on the official program, which was well typeset and had been broadcast for weeks over every imaginable form of social media. There were even, somewhat inexplicably, guys hired to ride bikes through the town with big banners during the festival. As a well-organised, curated and somewhat sanitised cultural festival it was a massive success. The massive parties on the beach in the evening added some well-needed chaos back into the mix, with the heaving crowd happily flowing around the dozens of people sleeping on the sand. Police formed a line hundreds of metres long to stop any ill-fated attempts as swimming and armoured vehicles stationed at the entrances. The festival ended with a big ceremony in a brand new area with limited seating that we managed to sneak our way into with some quick thinking from my friends. Seeing this very rich expression of centuries of religious practice reinforced to me how much (white) Australia is lacking in this regard. There’s a kind of dismissive approach to this kind of local culture as arbitrary and useless that I think is a bit misguided. One of many lessons. Still exhaustedly buzzing after the festival, it was time to head to the economic capital Cotonou. Bloodlessly, J&amp;BoB"

    ,"content"  : "Hi BoBers, After Lomé, I had an impromptu stay with Caroline’s friend Jean-Christophe in Aného, close to the border with Benin. I was originally just stopping by for a drink, but he was such an endless fountain of facts that I asked if I could stay the night. He’s been a consultant in the region for many years, mostly with breweries, and had a lot to say about everything from local politics to relationships to 60’s rock and roll. A very intelligent guy. The rest of the ride to the festival in Ouidah was largely uneventful for a change. I managed to get myself lost, was redirected by some kids and subsequently chastised by a local leader for not having a guide and not introducing myself to the local authorities. He insisted that the local area was full of terrorists. Then, realising the implication about his leadership abilities, insisted that it was very safe despite the rampant terrorism. I meet big men like him quite often. The best thing to do is just smile, nod and fake a very infectious illness as soon as possible. I arrived in Ouidah still feeling a little socially overwhelmed. The single night of solitude while camping hadn’t fully scratched my hermit’s itch. Unfortunately, Ouidah’s accomodation had long since been booked out for the festival. I had no plan at all about where I would stay, but was sure I would find somewhere to put my tent. Thankfully, Caroline organised a connection with someone in Ouidah. In fact it was her friend’s son’s friend’s nephew, so all in all my friend’s aunt’s friend’s friend’s son’s friend’s nephew. It’s crazy how far I’ve come with such loose connections. Things got a little weird from there. Expecting just a little help finding a camp spot, I found out that, without informing me, the son had come all the way from Cotonou to guide me through the festival for the next few days. Originally, I found this very sweet, if a little forward and slightly restrictive, but later his uncle, who’d organised the whole thing arrived to talk, clearly drunk. Conversation came relatively quickly to compensation for the family, with the nephew looking on timidly in the background. Checkmate. In the end, I paid. Probably too much. This deliberate mixing of relationships and money is something I really detest, but I didn’t have much choice. I sweated myself to sleep on my sleeping mat, excited about the first day of the festival. Excitedly, J&amp;BoB"

    ,"content"  : "Hi BoBers, With my poor little introverted self feeling quite exhausted by the constant company, I left Accra after a tearful goodbye with the family, followed by one glorious, solitary night camping under a mango tree. After five mangos for breakfast, I crossed the border to Togo (totally straightforward) and arrived at Alice’s aunt’s friend Caroline’s place in Lomé. She’s spent the last 14 years of her retirement there and, now in her late sixties, her house is a little oasis in the city—both in nature and French culture. The garden was dense with plants and the interior packed with art; tiny sculptures and paintings lurking everywhere. The walls were covered with a new exhibit she was preparing on the history of clothing for the local museum, her desk with cartons of cigarettes, and each room had a jam-jar ashtray filled with water. My occasional social smoking accelerated massively during our after-dinner conversations on the terrace (decelerating has been an ongoing struggle). We ate crêpes and cheese (!!), drank red wine, and bonded over a shared love of Terry Pratchett—she even had a custom miniature Discworld coffee table. The closest I’ve come to being a tourist in a long time, we hired a tuk-tuk and toured Lomé. Full of vim and vigour, she chatted constantly with the driver. We shared an avocado sandwich on the beach and answered questions from a random guy curious about geography. Caroline had close ties with the country’s only circus school which specialsed in stilt walking - a traditional performance art in Togo. We went to visit and they even let me have a go myself. The stilts flex as you walk, but by the end, sweaty and sore, I could manage a few small manoeuvres. Part of me wanted to drop everything and join the circus. Learning with your body feels far more natural than the dry study I do back home in front of a computer. On my final evening, Caroline had a health scare that made it difficult to leave, but she insisted. With little time before the Voodoo festival in Benin, I hit the road—another separation from a fleeting, intense connection. Enchanté, J&amp;BoB"

A good quarter of all signs were for funerals or memorials - multi-day events after 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 years. The ages of some of the deceased I can only assume were wildly exaggerated. I regularly saw funerals for people ages 120 or more. Some people I spoke to said that the focus on the dead was bankrupting them and their families. Another quarter were for mega churches and their pastors, ranging from wholesome to apocalyptic to private-jet pyramid-scheme luxury. All of them out to convince people to join their “cross-over” sermons on new years night with diverse lessons for the new year. The other half was general commercial fare. Little roadside street food places are called food joints, which I find awesome. Enjoy! Over-crossed, J&amp;BoB"

    ,"content"  : "Hi BoBers, The week following the festival was, frankly, insane. On the 23rd of December I went to visit a friend from Kumasi who worked at the museum. Was he there the time we’d agreed or even during work hours? Of course not. Still, it gave me a chance to visit the museum, which was displaying solid gold jewellery from the region - ever so generously loaned by the British Museum for three years. The anger at having to return artefacts stolen from their land was written all over the guide’s face. Eventually my friend turned up. We had a quick chat and then it was time to leave, but by then it was already 3:30pm. I’d found a Couchsurfing host in Accra and, keen to arrive in time for Christmas, I had a terrible idea: no sleep till Accra. Ride the entire 270km from Kumasi through the night. It was brutal. My new Chinese headlamp only worked properly when plugged into my power bank, and trucks passed far too close in the dark. I lay down a couple of times to rest and passed out immediately, but luckily I’d set a timer. Somehow, I made it at 11:30 the next day after 20 hours. Exhausted but happy, I arrived at my host’s place, where he lived with his two brothers. We ate and I rested. The vibe was strange - partly because his friend’s house had burned down the day before, but also because nobody seemed to be working. They lived in a rich part of town. Bottles of spirits on the tables, joints on the terrace. For Christmas I went out with one brother who bought me beers and showed me off to his various girlfriends on video call. Not my scene at all. Later I saw him furiously typing on his laptop with a VPN open. Dating-site pest or romance scammer, I couldn’t be sure, but he was vaguely threatening, even when he was helping me. The plan was to stay for my birthday on the 26th. Instead, I fought every people-pleasing instinct I had and left. I met another host in his air-conditioned office. He offered me a cold drink and was horrified by how I’d been treated. All the tension I’d been holding onto finally released. He assured me we’d celebrate my birthday in style and sent his employee to guide me across the city to a nice hotel with ice-cold aircon and a king-size bed, which he paid for. It was a little strange, but he said he didn’t have space at his house. After a quick tour of one of his construction sites, I showered, rested, and gave him a call - something had come up, but he’d call me back later. He didn’t. I waited until midnight before going to sleep, and when I raised the topic later he refused to apologise. The next day I met a lovely guy fixing bikes from a pile of scrap parts in his backyard. I ended up staying with his family for four nights over New Year while waiting for my Togo e-visa. It was both lovely and heartbreaking. The rhythm of the days was slow. The kids were off school, so we played cards, I taught them about fixing bikes, and constantly shooed them away from the tools. The father of one mother had run off to another city; the other had died two years earlier. That left my friend the uncle, with chronic hip pain, as the father figure to two families. He scraped together a few dollars a day from kids fixing punctures; adults didn’t use bicycles anymore. He was quiet and gentle, but the pain and the constant interruptions - often for money he didn’t have - sometimes made him irritable. We talked a lot, he and I. The family was Muslim, but before every meal he said grace. At first I thought he was simply being welcoming, assuming I was Christian. The truth was deeper. Twenty years earlier he’d had a great job as a swimming instructor at a fancy hotel, living a bit of a fast life with drinking, girls, and parties. One day he had a complete mental breakdown - yelling, screaming - and was hospitalised, deeply ashamed. He lost his job and profession. No other fancy hotel would hire him. For years afterwards he struggled to find work and to understand what had happened. One evening he went outside, looked at the moon, and the word “Jesus” came to him. Since then he’s lived in a kind of Christian–Muslim limbo. I left on New Year’s Day after a muted celebration - New Year isn’t a big event for Muslims. Saying goodbye was incredibly hard. In just a few days they’d become a family to me. I made a small “feast” on my final night: pasta and fruit. One mother told me she normally didn’t buy fruit because it was too expensive. She was also horrified by how many onions I put into the sauce. The extent of their struggle nearly overwhelmed me. The kids were all bright, especially the girls. I offered to fund their schooling - USD 30 per semester, which they had been fighting tooth and nail to pull together. I also decided not to give any money directly to my friend, even though he desperately needed it. He sometimes drank, carrying the shame of a lapsed Muslim, and I didn’t want to risk it being wasted. It was a very difficult decision. Eventually I packed BoB and left, to tears on both sides. I left Accra completely exhausted after what was probably the most unique Christmas and New Year of my life. J&amp;BoB"

Each chief arrives with a posse of dancers, musicians and other sub-royalty. Lots of noise and colour. And lots and lots of gold. Originally I thought the crudely cast jewellery was gold-leaf. In fact it was all pure gold. There’s a reason this region was previously called the Gold Coast when it was under British rule. I also liked that the whole ceremony wasn’t taken too seriously. I had to bow before taking a picture with the king, who laughed at my efforts before everyone told me I did a great job. That is all to say that what might have been a useful convening of leaders centuries ago has turned into a little bit of a spectacle and party. Cameras and phones everywhere, trying to snap up a little of the glamour. Either way, I managed to get some nice photos - hope you like them. Festively, J&amp;BoB"

Two friends, Jeremy and Enosh, rode with me the first day which helped with the transition back to riding. Day 2 started with a broken pedal. I rode 15 km on one pedal to the next town, which was surprisingly doable. I chose a serene and remote beach border crossing which started with a small boat. Some rasta boys paid for the boat and invited me to stay; I only rested in their lovely wooded courtyard and watched them sort mountains of weed in big bowls. About 25 km along the beach to the border turned into 5 km of dragging BoB through sand at high tide. I flagged down truckers and got a lift. The sand road is so rough you have to stand — a wild, standing roller coaster. The border was a row of small huts and very relaxed officials. After crossing, the driver offered me a drink and later his house to sleep in; the bar owner heated water for a shower. The driver left on another trip that night, returned at 6 am after mechanical trouble, and was up at 7 to offer me breakfast before leaving again. An incredibly hard working guy. I also had the most scenic toilet break of my life — a hole on the beach staring at the waves. Riding inland I passed illegal gold-mining towns built around sluices and pumps. The people I met were incredibly kind an pure, offering food, beds. One man offered to travel 400 km to join me in Accra for Christmas. I also met David, 16, working alone at a petrol station since he was ten; his father checks in weekly. He captains his football team but his parents don’t want him to play football at all and push him to study medicine. I arrived in Kumasi full of stories and ready for the festival.

When I’m on the move, life is simple. Eat. Sleep. Talk. Ride. Stopping leaves me with a pile of amorphous priorities and seemingly endless time to dance with my demons. Luckily, with lots of rest and some lovely people I was able to recharge and left Abidjan about a week ago feeling refreshed and ready for the rest of the journey to South Africa. All in all, I spent just over three months in Accra and it was huge mix of things. Depression, deep introspection and insight. Loneliness and wonderful company. It was also a taste of my old digital life, with its comforting familiarity but also its subtle disconnection. I worked daily on some projects, built up a routine and made myself scrambled eggs, salad sandwiches and endless cups of tea. I did a disastrous interview on local tv, ran a 10km race in thongs, got yelled at for changing pants outside of the ministry of interior, learnt korean drinking songs, massively improved my French, ate the best fish of my life, explored an abandoned monument and a house shaped like a crocodile, visited both a tiny recording studio and the largest basilica in the world and spent many glorious hours with BoB in the empty night hours. And honestly, I felt pretty shitty during most of it. Which just goes to show how subjective it all is. Either way, I was lucky enough to meet some truly wonderful people and had a wonderful send-off where they even bought me a birthday cake in advance, just in case I wasn’t able to celebrate properly in Ghana. Truly kind and generous people. Staying in one place was a great opportunity to see a place in more detail and form a deeper connection. I left Abidjan full of energy, excitement and a newfound peace; with a heavy heart, but two friends to accompany me to the border. Refreshed and ready, J&amp;BoB"

I was on the verge of just getting a taxi to Monrovia, but luckily nobody turned up, because I would have missed what came next. I sewed it back together again and rode on another 20km to the next guest house. The music at the bar outside was deafening. Reception was empty and there was a group of about 15 staff and locals yelling at each other out back. I went and joined the only foreigner, yelling at eachother over our beers. He was South African ex-special forces, had been living on-and-off in Liberia for 15 years and was working on a project, building solar powered water towers - a huge improvement over the ever-present hand-pumps and wells. I stayed with him in his air-conditioned (!!) guest house that night and he gave me a tour of the brilliant work they’ve been doing the following day. His wife came and picked us up that day and I’ve been staying with them in Monrovia since. I’ve been absolutely spoilt. After a pretty woeful diet in Robertsport, the first night we had pizza and beer. The next, pub food while watching the Springboks play the Wallabies. The next quinoa, salmon and salad. They’ve been unbelievably hospitable. We watched movies on the couch in the evenings with their beautiful dogs. They’ve singlehandedly cured my homesickness over the past few days. The Liberians have also been wonderfully generous. I stopped and chatted with a shop owner who gave me his own charging cable for free when we realised that he couldn’t sell me one that worked. A guy at the bike shop gave me a tube for free. I’m learning that the trick is to have time to stop and chat. Sometimes the time stress of expats can feel dehumanising for people used to a slower pace. I left Monrovia almost too rested - I’d ridden 3 days of the last month. Time to get back on the bike and head to Ivory Coast. Refuelled, J&amp;BoB Sewn up tyre wall. In the end, I only needed it for 20km before getting a lift to Monrovia. My repair site. Luckily it wasn’t raining too heavily. Chris’s guest house. Very spartan. He was cooking basically with a kettle and a barbie. Pub food while watching the Springboks/Wallabies match. Home made salad and Salmon. Divine. Monrovia has the feeling of a mid-sized American city, strip malls an everything. Not like anything I’ve seen in Africa so far. Fried fucking ice cream! A lot of very old-school hellfire Christians in Liberia as well. “Life is short. Death is certain. Hell is real. Jesus saves”. Oof"

    ,"content"  : "Hi BoBers, Travis and I moved on to a small village called Aïguel, entirely fenced off to protect from pests. The entire interior was a single flourishing green field, punctuated by houses. I’ve never seen agriculture and residential land so tightly intertwined. It was also overflowing with avocados. So much so that they were practically worthless to the locals. No toast though, unfortunately otherwise I might’ve exploded into a cloud of millenial joy. Due to a very African mix up involving a visiting friend, bad roads and another village with exactly the same name 15km away, we stayed two nights. Then we struck out into the countryside for the most beautiful hiking of this trip. Flowing green grass. Crystal clear water rushing over rapids and crashing over waterfalls. The air was brisk, so welcome after the sweltering heat of the coast. Thunderstorms loomed and rumbled over the horizon, everpresent. I’ve used up my adjective quota for the day so I’ll just let the photos do the talking. We found an incredible spot to camp and were considering staying another night before the ear flies struck again. We had a choice. Either stay in our tents the entire day, stay outside constantly guarding our orifices or head back. We chose to head back, packed our bikes and made the gruelling trip over corrugated, rocky tracks back to the main road. It was sproket-tooth-ratting, gruelling riding. On the way we passed over a semi-famous “vine” suspension bridge, which had been thoroughly tamed. For the better because it already felt sketchy with 3cm thick cable under our feet. It was a tight squeeze and took more than half an hour to ferry the bags and then cross the swaying bridge, two at a time while avoiding snagging the pedals and handlebars. The casual cruelty towards animals is hard to witness. Cows are branded with knives and live chickens are bound to cars and motorcycles for trips lasting hours. Too many human problems to worry about animal welfare, I guess. After reaching the main road, we had a quick break at a hotel with hot showers (!!) and then set off for Freetown, Sierra Leone.

It was also nice to have a bit of personal space after many nights staying in villages, always surrounded and interacting. The place was no-running-water cheap, but it was clean and the roof didn’t drip in the massive thunderstorms that shook the city nightly. Getting the parts I needed was unbelievably easy by African standards. David from the market showed me to the bike shop. We stopped and ate a delicious fish and rice lunch with the owner who then sold me the exact tyre I needed. After Labe, the first stop was the Saala waterfall, imposing, titanic, carved out of the rock by giant talons. We camped for two nights with some friends from Labe. It was mostly quiet but some teenagers dropped by at one point. After praying they cooked up a storm on a campfire. They threw some gang signs while taking photos with me topless. I hope their friends will be impressed. Over a delicious campfire dinner, we were privileged enough to hear some absolutely brutal stories about the tough lives of women in the area, including child marriage, pregnancy and female circumcision. The women have unbelievably little autonomy. So hard to square with the generosity and kindness with which I’ve been treated so far. Our souls heavy and bellies full, the next challenge was to cross the river. The water flowed fast but wasn’t terribly deep. We might have been overly cautious but we’d seen the waterfall less than 100m downstream and wanted to be absolutely certain to not take that deadly waterslide. A few crossings for the baggage (with Shisha stops for courage) were enough to get us across. We’re now in a town called AÃ¯guel. The area is unbelievably fecund. The village is fenced off and essentially one big lush green field, dotted with houses. We’ll head off hiking for a few days - more waterfalls - before finally making our way towards Conakry and the Sierra Leone border. Soaked and happy, J&amp;BoB"

But I’ve also been shocked by the pure friendliness and hospitality of its people. We crossed the border by canoe. After we had our clearest experience of cyclist privilege so far, when a soldier asked us for a stamp fee (he didn’t even have a stamp) and his friend told him to let the sweaty and muddy travellers through because we’d “suffered enough already”. And we continued to suffer. At the shoulder of the wet season the humidity is 100% at night. Big storms roll through most evenings and everything is covered in mud. Nothing dries. Afternoons are the worst. 70% humidity and 35 degrees. It’s impossible to ride and so you sweat in the shade, constantly shooing little flies seeking refuge in your ears. We stayed with a local, Talahatou, and his family for a couple of nights for the Muslim festival of Tabaski. There was an endless supply of food. As a recently relapsed vegetarian it was intense. Goats are slaughtered on the streets. Blood, meat and pelts everywhere. The goat head soup was too much for me. Our friend had studied in Conakry and was back with his family until he could afford another year of uni. He had a very negative view of village life and Africa in general. It was hard to square with the hospitality we received, but we definitely get a biased picture as white guests. His picture of western life was biased as well. I’d love to write more about this dynamic later because I think it’s essential for understanding migration, which comes up daily here. I’m reaching a part of the trip where my gear (and body) is starting to slowly falter. Bald tyres (after only 500km!), broken zippers, stuck cables, shifters, bottle holder and kickstand and a couple of lost toenails. I’m holding out for Freetown to fix what I can. After nearly two weeks on the road, we arrived in Labe, with a shopping list, relieved to have a place to rest. Drowning in kindness (and sweat), J&amp;BoB"

Also drinking too many Caipirinhas at night and coming home in the early hours. I was happiest drinking tea and sorting out my photos, but I fell into empty procrastination without the clear path forward of riding. Suddenly a thousand things to do without order or precedence. So after two weeks in Bissau and more than 3 weeks off the bike, I was glad to get back on the road. Travis and I left the city by a small path that turned into a muddy river bank. We had to hail some young boys over with a tiny dugout canoe over a small but rapid river. We crossed one at a time, with 4 or 5 men standing in the boat with us and waded through mud to escape the other side. Mud will be a constant companion from now on, I think.Later, we stopped for dinner at a restaurant with a guy who was grilling meat A drunk “shaman” was there, who could make love potions and was sure the best path for us was back north through Senegal (it wasn’t.) The first big storm of the season arrived and there was a bunch of celebrations with dancing and singing. We camped inside the restaurant that night and, next to our tents, the shaman performed a ritual on a drunk woman with a candle and some water.The riding has been tough. It’s hot, humid and the roads are not in good shape. I’ve also clearly lost some fitness. But we’re making tracks and will likely cross the border to Guinea tomorrow.

Some pigs broke free and ate someone’s lunch and bags of charcoal. Music blaring, we drank and danced while cruising past palm-lined white beaches. Finally, everyone cheered on the soldiers standing at attention on the dock, there to deal with the chaos about to disembark. The capital is Bubaque, powered by diesel generators that run only sporadically at night. We spent our afternoons marinating in sweat in the stale, humid air. Later, we had a wonderful dinner of home-cooked rigatoni and tiramisu to celebrate Klaus the Dane’s birthday. Definitely not on my Bubaque bingo card. The evening stretched until 3:30am, filled with toasts, good food and discussion about farming, technology and culture. The host, Angelo, a Italian/Guinean, is the son of an Italian agricultural engineer and a local queen. His father was a local legend and had massively helped Bijagos to develop. Big shoes to fill, but Angelo had many ideas about how to contribute. We later crammed into a wooden boat to visit Canhabaque, where Angelo’s mother once ruled before emigrating to Italy. It is tradition to give a gift to the chief of the village, so we brought plenty of alcohol. We stayed a slightly-awkward two nights in a village. We spoke only a little Portuguese, they spoke only a little French. A lot of sitting in silence. We witnessed a dance relating to the Fanado, a coming-of-age ceremony, with drunk men dancing with carved sticks and packets of biscuits tied to their backs with plastic cord. Bijagans are notoriously secretive about the ceremony, but we couldn’t really ask any questions anyway. In a fishing village we met the lovely Ibrahima who spoke great French, was the fittest 65-year-old I’ve ever met and was a wellspring of stories and information. Someone dropped some of the last night’s catch for us in the morning, which we grilled on the fire. But after 10 days I was ready for the mainland. Exhausted by the heat. Frustrated and often bored trying to communicate. I needed rest. Merrily ferrily, J&amp;BoB"

    ,"content"  : "Hi BoBers, The border crossing into Guinea-Bissau was uneventful again, apart from the Senegalese police being confused by us putting on sunscreen. We decided to break up the route with a boat from the border town of Sao-Dominigos to Cacheau. The boat ride started with the drivers taking shots together. It middled with the boat crashing into the mangroves and getting stuck. Thankfully, it didn’t end by crashing into the dock. We arrived in the evening and bizarrely managed to haggle a place in the courtyard of a fancy hotel for 3USD per night. The roads leading to Bissau from the border are not in good condition. Often they’re so potholed that the sandy piste next to the road becomes the preferred route. By the time you get closer to Bissau, perhaps for the best, the entire road is just sand. This is the main road from the border to the capital. Guinea-Bissau is considerably poorer than Senegal. Not great for road tyres but BoB but BoB and I were cruising with my new offroad monsters. Guinea-Bissau is also considerably boozier. As soon as we crossed the border, red and white wine casks were being sold by the side of the road. The first large town we stopped in had many people drinking on the street on Thursday afternoon. It was fun, but started to get a bit chaotic by the evening. Quite often it was harder to find a coke than a beer. One night I ticked off one of the random items on my trip bucket list by setting up camp while completely blindfolded. I had multiple punctures when we arrived in Bissau. I was still using tubes for my old 35mm tyres that were clearly stretched well beyond their limits. We found a lovely hostel for the night and prepared ourselves for the ferry across to the Bijagos islands. Tipsy J&amp;BoB"

It took a few days to get there, mostly on dirt roads and a bit of sandy offroad. Then by an eventful crossing of the Casamance river in a boat which was massively overloaded. The boat was also clearly hard to manoeuvre because the driver smashed it into the dock on the other side. As I got out, my foot went straight through the damaged dock, but luckily my other foot was on a firm plank. Again, we came across the most wonderful and welcoming people. We stopped in a village for a late lunch and everything was closed. We asked one of the women and she brought a big plate of food that I think was her own dinner and offered it to us. She refused payment (I had to hide it in her house). One of the other women even chased the kids that surrounded us away with a stick. How kind! The three of us decided to rest for a few days in Ziguinchor and rented a sprawling three bedroom apartment together. It’s a huge advantage of travelling in a group, often for the price of a dorm bed per person. A private space and space to sprawl and cook real food is glorious after weeks of pasta, camping and shared hotel rooms. For a few days we drank beers and watched youtube. Travis caught some ice-hockey games. Getting the Guinea-Bissau visa was laughably easy - paying and watching the ambassador fill out the visa. I also found some new tyres for BoB. 29” 60mm-wide monsters that breeze through sand. Much more appropriate for the coming wet season. I had to trim off the side knobs from the rear tyre to make it fit - the biggest tyres you could possibly fit. This stop was refreshing but honestly I was feeling quite tired. I was really enjoying travelling in a group. But not having time to myself was starting to weigh on my mind. The constant change, new cultures, new people, new places was also slowly too much. I needed a rest. Somewhere to process and recharge. I decided to take a break in Guinea-Bissau. We picked up a French couple, Loum and Alberic, that I’d previously met in Morocco - making us now a gang of five - and set off for the Guinea-Bissau border. Tiredly, J&amp;BoB"

    ,"content"  : "Hi BoBers, The border crossing into the Gambia was quick and easy. Our first stop was a campground run by the incredibly open Ibrahima. He told us heartbreaking stories of the exploitation and mistreatment, first as a modern slave in the UAE then as a migrant in Algeria. We all know that it’s happening, but it’s totally different to see a victim in person. The worst thing is that the recruiters are Gambians who knowingly lure their countrymen into hell for a commission. Ibrahima said he would kill his recruiter if he saw him on the street. His matter-of-fact tone suggested he wasn’t exaggerating. Gambia is English-speaking and the smallest country in Africa. A narrow slice out of Senegal hugging the Gambia river. The riding was brutal. The Harmattan, the dusty, hot wind that blows south west from the Sahara, blew constantly in our faces. We battled these 45 degree winds, under dull skies grey with dust, and sweated through 35 degree nights in our tents, covered in grime. Stopping during the afternoon was no longer about comfort, but about necessity. None of our bodies were functioning properly. The kindness we experienced made it bearable. We were invited to share food multiple times and a kind farmer let us camp under his mango trees. We woke up to a breakfast of freshly-fallen perfectly-ripe mangos. Another night, we stayed on an observation platform in the forest and chatted with an inspirational local conservationist, MJ, who was thanklessly protecting local wildlife while also supporting the local community. He casually talked about hippos breaking in and gorging on local rice paddies. As with many things in Africa, he had many ideas but resources were the main limitation. Our final stop in Gambia was Janjanbureh/Georgetown, the site of a British settlement for freed slaves. To add a little spice, the island has a slave house and freedom tree, both dedicated to slavery that almost certainly didn’t exist in the area. This lie exemplified the place,full of chancers looking for quick cash. One particularly enterprising guy gave us some mangos and got my phone number. He still texts me trying to get money for mango-tree-related injuries. Cooked J&amp;BoB"

Travis is a Canadian guy who seems to have been everywhere - Chinese jail, camping with camel riders in the desert and hunting pigs deep in the rainforests of PNG. Antoine is 19 years old with a disability affecting his mobility and an almost encyclopaedic knowledge of geography and political history. He’d hate it if I called him inspiring, so I won’t go on. I spent a couple of nights in the resort town Saly and unintentionally walked into a local bar filled with aging white men and young black women. As I was leaving, I saw a man clearly in his 80s being helped up the stairs by his 20-something partner. The lie of it all, the false intimacy and concealed intentions, really bothered me. Saly is notorious for this. Afterwards, we went to the island of Fadiouth, famous for being made entirely out of clam shells. It is also known for being a place of peaceful coexistence between Christianity and Islam. The imam and priest even visit each other’s congregations for important events. This kind of tolerance and respect is desperately needed in the world. From there to Gambia we crossed multiple landscapes - dry savannah dotted thorny acacia and the occasional baobab, mangrove lined tidal river deltas drifting into shadier and wetter areas, dwarfed by towering mangoes and African mahogany, close to 30m tall. We took some time and some boats to explore the delta of the Sine and Saloum rivers and spent a night on one of the less-frequented islands, and camped in a half-built resort. Finally, we stayed a few days with a French couple who were building a campground and charged us 1.5USD per night to stay on their beautiful property. He had spent much of his life in Africa working for MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res and the WHO and had a bunch of interesting stories to tell.

The transition from the desert in Mauritania to the sometimes-green savanna of northern Senegal was massive. I saw fields of rice and vegetables. People’s clothes suddenly had colour. Occasionally I would see some bare hair or a shoulder (gasp!) Senegal is still a Muslim country, but much more liberal than their northern neighbour. I met a young German guy, Johan, who was travelling the coast at a blistering pace and we had a few speedy days to get to Dakar. I slept for a night with the rooftop goats of an alcoholic Couchsuring host before cutting off my stay and moving to a hostel for a week. Dakar is a kind of biker’s oasis on the west-coast route. It’s a commercial hub and a place to rest and repair the bike - the only city with somewhat-readily-available parts for touring bikes for at least another 2,500km in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. My front wheel had started to make a loud clicking and rumbling sound since the desert. I finally got it checked in St Louis and found the front bearings were pitted, likely because the fine desert dust had penetrated past the seal. I searched hard in Dakar for some replacements, even pulling apart the bearings of existing bikes to check them for compatibility. In the end, they were just too rare and we had to grease them and hope they would last until I could reach a care package with replacements sent to Freetown in Sierra-Leone by a long-suffering friend in Germany. I also had a broken zip on my frame bag (rather poorly) replaced on the street for about 1.50 USD by a kid with a portable handheld sewing machine. Senegal is very serious about clothing, with even tiny villages having a dedicated tailor. Many people have tailored clothing and look really fashionable. I also had some rather fashionable front bottle racks tailor-made for BoB. By chance I met a friend from Morocco and ended up staying with him and some friends in an apartment for another few days. We got on so well that, after a quick visit to the westernmost point of Africa, we set off south towards Gambia together. Tailored J&amp;BoB"

The police checked my passport at a few checkpoints on the way, so I was glad that I’d waited to get a visa. Riding around Nouakchott is frustrating. Piles of sand cover the street and the cars drive fast, not accounting for this poor cyclist, doing his best to ride straight in deep sand. This is truly a desert city. The next week was purely about rest. The Senegal visa process was straightforward, quick and free - which made all of the fuss at the border even more galling. I broke my budget for a clean and calm hostel. I ate restaurant food. I took some medicine for the parasites and my stomach finally settled. I met interesting and diverse people, including a guy from Casablanca who was planning to walk to South Africa.

The riding was physically challenging but simple - the goal just to survive. A lot like the life in the desert, I think. I would end the days covered in a crust of salt. Even though water is scarce, stored in giant water bladders outside of buildings, it is freely shared. So I didn’t have trouble finding the enormous amounts of water I was drinking (and sweating) every day - more than 10 litres. I adapted by riding early, stopping around 12pm and resting until 4 or 5pm during the most unbearable parts of the day. Luckily, there were many low-roofed open structures around, that people used exactly for this purpose. I also learned that goats can eat cardboard - not much is wasted here. There are some exceptions for Ramadan for travelers and for the very young, elderly and sick. But, while I was struggling to just exist in the heat, there were men working in the full sun, in long pants and long sleeves for modesty who were also fasting. Truly impressive! Also a sign that Muslim men, as well as women, have to bear a lot of discomfort in the name of religion. In Nouakchott I stayed one night with a Ghanan guy, illegally in Mauritania, who was selling some street food. His apartment was next to an informal dump, had no plumbing and they had to carry water up and wastewater down to the ground level. He didn’t go out at night, because that’s when the immigration police are most active. Truly a tough guy trying hard to make things work. He and his girlfriend had a huge argument about me staying after I arrived and so I awkwardly left early the next day, despite him insisting that I stay. There are two main border crossings between Mauritania and Senegal. I planned to cross at the calmer Diama crossing, but rode 10km past the turnoff. I decided to cross at the notoriously corrupt Rosso instead to save myself the ride back. How bad can it be, I thought? Sandily, J&amp;BoB"

    ,"content"  : "Hi BoBers, The Mauritania/Senegal border at Rosso is notorious, even in West Africa, and they’ve grown quite sophisticated with their scams. Because tourists ask for receipts to avoid bribes, men now sit, right next to the police, with receipt machines selling tickets for the free ferry. I was even followed 10km to the border by a man on a motorbike from “customs” who tried to force me to pay some money for the ferry. Feeling quite clever after avoiding both of those scams, I arrived at the Senegalese side and was promptly rejected - I didn’t have a visa. It’s a long story, but unlike many countries (EU, US, Canada even India), Australian citizens need a visa for Senegal. Visa on arrival is possible but only at the Dakar airport. Information online is sparse and often contradictory. I originally planned to use my UK passport, which expired before I arrived. I have many excuses but the truth is that I wasn’t properly prepared. So I needed to return to Nouakchott. What followed was one of the most frustrating experiences of my life. At first Mauritanian immigration said annulling my exit stamp (i.e. letting me back into the country) would be no problem. Then the big boss, a big-bearded-and-bellied man who sat imperiously hunched on an office chair while everyone else ate dinner comfortably on the ground, just told me to leave the border without changing anything - effectively to enter his country illegally. I didn’t want to. Either way, the police, who controlled the gate, then told me I couldn’t leave because it would be illegal. For three days I was trapped at this border, eating stale bread and pasta from the store. Camping in no-mans-land, visiting the toilet multiple times per day with quite bad diarrhea. For three days I ping-ponged between the immigration, who insisted that I enter their country illegally and the police at the border who refused me entry. All of this with my terrible french. I made friends with money changers and migrants deported from Mauritania. I saw rampant and unabashed corruption. Eventually, got a new e-visa on Friday evening, with the help of a Swiss trucker’s contacts, and was able to leave. Borderline experienced, J&amp;BoB"

    ,"content"  : "Hi BoBers, There is a huge train in Mauritania that delivers iron ore from an inland mine in Zouerat to the coastal port of Nouadhibou. For decades, locals have used the empty carriages to travel for free into the desert. More recently, it has attracted travel influencers. This brought corruption, moving some money across the enormous wealth divide. I took the train from Nouadhibou to a pitstop town called Choum. The station policeman was in full swagger mode, forcing toursts into the passenger car, but really just wanting a bribe. We moved on a bit and he hassled us but didn’t ask for money. I travelled with a cyclist friend from Hong Kong, David and a badass Chinese solo tourist, Peipei. We learned quickly that this train is not a passenger train. A thunderous roar in the distance rushed towards us and suddenly the wagon floor jerked with a deafening crash. David was standing and fell to his knees. I thought the train had been hit from behind, but this was just the reality of traveling in a train without any cushioning, and happened often. We were off! We took photos and admired the view and sunset. It was too loud to talk. After the sun set, all that was left was to read my book and try to sleep. Unfortunately, the moon was almost full so we couldn’t really see the stars, even though there was almost no light pollution in the desert. In the middle of the night the train stopped, some people disembarked and two young guys jumped into our wagon, one wearing a vest and with a radio. They said we weren’t allowed to be there and yelled at us for a bit. We played dumb and they left. They returned later and asked for money and we paid them about 5 euros each. Only afterwards did my hazy brain register that they were probably just some enterprising young men from the village. We arrived in Choum at 3am, found a spot to camp and grabbed a few hours sleep before washing the bikes and heading off to Atar. All in all a pretty rough and dirty trip through some beautiful scenery, but not nearly as dangerous or difficult as all that, honestly. In ore, J&amp;BoB"

    ,"content"  : "Hi BoBers, Ramadan means that my usual, bourgeois habit of eating mostly at restaurants isn’t possible anymore. Even more difficult is that people tend to gather late into the night, wake up early to eat, and then rest again until midday or later. And so, when I reached the last store for 120km in the morning it was closed. With my visa nearly expired, I couldn’t wait until evening, so I had to take a detour to a local fishing village, pushing my bike through sand around huge dunes that had formed over the road that nobody could afford to remove. The village was rough and clearly a place for work. Dense with the smell of engine oil, sweat and fish. Tiny dorms filled with men dreaming of their distant families. It’s times like these that I’m overwhelmed with gratitude for my many privileges. I was invited to my first Iftar - the meal for breaking the fast - by two soldiers guarding a phone tower. No photos unfortunately because I wasn’t technically supposed to be there. That night, I slept under the stars, at peace in the desert. The riding was tough and the landscape desolate and harsh. For the first time in my life I have a sunburnt lower lip. The border crossing was ten times more stressful though. Like many Aussies, I also have a UK passport, which I used for Morocco. This passport is nearly expired, so I needed to transition to my Australian passport at the border, which has never been a problem for me. This slight deviation from protocol led to me crossing no-mans-land three times in the blazing sun, begging imigration of both sides to let me through on my Australian passport. Both needed a stamp from the other side first. Stalemate. The only thing the Moroccans offered was to give me a visa on my nearly-expired UK passport, the least legal option of all. If I was unlucky, I would need to cross back into Morocco, ride or hitchhike ~350km to Dakhla, fly to the canary islands and then to Nouadhibou. Finally, after being very demure, patient and polite, the Mauritanians relented. The ride to Nouadhibou was glorious with a 30km/h tailwind - like riding a racing-cloud. The city and traffic is chaotic and I imagine only a taste of what’s to come. J&amp;BoB"

Lots of military checkpoints and police presence, which some people quite casually hid in a compartment in the bus to avoid. I could taste adventure in the air as soon as I arrived in Dakhla. People were very talkative. One guy told me about his English wife and kids and how you can’t trust African people (he was clearly Moroccan). Another peppered me with questions about why I’m not a Muslim over google translate.  Ramadan started yesterday so all of the restaurants are closed and things generally seem slower, but otherwise no problems. I feel a bit hard done by because there is supposed to be a consistent tailwind heading south to the border - “the trade winds” - and I’ve actually be fighting a mighty headwind all day, averaging 11km/h at some point. Annoyingly I also had a headwind heading north from dahkla yesterday. Not fair. I’m currently camping on the tropic of cancer line. Some soldiers walked by holding ak-47s, but luckily they were just walking home and didn’t move me on.  Still another 200 km to go to the border. Could be a breeze. Could be a slog. J&amp;BoB"

I tapped into a reserve of teeth-gritted, stubborn, plodding mule energy that I didn’t know I had.  It’s a bit of an irony that you can’t stay and enjoy the summits and passes because they’re too cold. At one of them I found my water bottle half frozen and couldn’t even bear taking off my gloves for a picture. I also used an ice axe and crampons for the first time which made me feel like a real mountaineer.  On the final day, we woke up at 4am for the summit at sunrise and then a 2400 metre decent to the starting point, Imlil.  So here I am at the end, fingertips still tingling from the cold exposure, blisters on every toe, one toenail cracked and the other detached from kicking footholds in the snow. It was a huge endeavour and I’m completely spent. I just reached the coast and BoB. My visa is running out and I’m not fully recovered yet, so I will need to catch the (22 hour!) bus down to Dakhla and then finally leave Morocco after almost three months for the next country: Mauritania!

The biggest difference between the two city centres is the traffic. In all other cities I visited, the medina is a walking-only network of narrow, dark and cool alleys. In Marrakesh, these alleys are filled with scooters and even cars. This makes the already crowded space oppressive with noise and smoke. I’ve never been great with lots of hustle and bustle so honestly it’s been a little overwhelming for me. We’re also paying significantly more for basically everything here. After taking a photo of a group playing music from at least 10 metres away, a man with a sixth sense for photographers magically appeared next to me holding out a tamborine for a tip. It’s hard not to feel like we’re getting ripped off. Tomorrow I’m off to hike around Toubkal mountain and Alice is heading back to Agadir to fly home after almost exactly 3 months together :( Soon to be just J&amp;BoB"

I was looking forward to really pushing myself and testing my fitness. By the second morning of riding I had a fever and noticed a painful lump on the inside of my bum cheek. Instead of riding further, I decided to catch the bus to Agadir, sweating and feverish for the whole 5 hour trip. I went straight to the clinic and was told to take antibiotics and wait for five days before it could be drained. The three most painful days of my life followed. I couldn’t sit, lie down or stand without intense pain. I was prescribed opiates for the pain which also cause constipation. I won’t go into more detail. The abscess burst early and I ended up in the clinic. I was taken immediately into surgery, put into a maternity bed, with stirrups and a curtain, then given an epidural with zero forewarning. As they began surgery a newborn baby screamed from the theatre next door - my own little childbirth experience. The next two days were hell, being “cared” for by staff that seemed to either ignore or actively dislike me. My dressings weren’t changed until we asked and my sheets were covered in blood. They brought antibiotics for me only when we asked. It was supposed to be a day procedure but the surgeon didn’t come to see me until the next morning, so I had to stay the night. The clinic kept no records (their invoice hilariously itemised the entire procedure and inpatient stay as a single word “abscess”), so I’m unlikely to get my money back from my health insurance. I’ve spent the last few weeks relaxing and recovering, first from the surgery, then from a case of what I think was gout - also extremely painful. I moved from Agadir to a quieter beach town called Tamaraght and now am in Essaouira. And voilÃ , we’re up to the present. I’m planning to do a big hike in the Atlas mountains while I wait. I’ve been languishing a bit in Tamaraght and craving a bit of adventure. Hopefully, I’ll be ready to ride again in a couple of weeks, inshallah (god willing). J&amp;BoB"

I was basically locked in the ward until Alice went and paid with my card. We asked what they do with people that are alone and they replied, almost confused “nobody ever comes alone”. The nurses needed to be reminded about post-op antibiotics and changing my dressings. I was in some serious pain and felt pretty trapped by the whole thing, placing my health in the hands of people that seemed pretty disinterested in actually caring for me. But, I’m healthy now, resting and slowly recovering. BoB also had a service and a clean and is fitter then ever.

We crossed vast desert steppe, dead-flat with the Atlas mountains always visible, snow-capped and towering above us. The transition to the south of the mountains was also stark - just as raw but suddenly with oases, date palms and slightly warmer weather. We had trouble with the police again. Late one afternoon, some big storm clouds were approaching. We were already freezing cold, so we stopped to set up camp to avoid getting wet as well. A car that had been slowly following us stopped as well. Suspicious, we asked him what he wanted and he told us that we couldn’t stay there and needed to continue to a guest house in the next town. Watching the sun set and knowing that arguing wouldn’t bring anything, we rode another 10 km in the setting sun and through frigid rain. We negotiated with the guest house owner, who opened his guest house just for us. He was paid less than he wanted to open his entire hotel and we were forced to ride through the rain instead of just camping. Nobody was particularly happy. Apparently, alcoholics also roam these deserted plains. We also experienced lovely hospitality again - being invited for food by a lovely woman Habiba and then by Mohammed, who invited us for a huge plate of couscous that we assumed was for everyone, but turned out to just be for the two of us. We ended up being a bit of a spectacle. The room filled with a bunch of elderly relatives who greeted everyone in the room individually (including us) and who insisted on me covering my sensuous knees. After a brief stop to celebrate New Year’s, Alice took the bus to the desert city of Ouarzazat and I rode to make up time. What was supposed to take 2 or 3 days instead took one. My biggest day yet, feeling totally in tune with my body and the bike. This ride awakened a ravenous hunger in me, that was only sated with literally 5 main meals for lunch the next day. The next plan was to head to Agadir, then split up from Alice and test my fitness riding some big days south to the Mauritanian border. J&amp;BoB"

I’m going to try and keep this up to date from now on and I’ll catch up with old stuff when I get the chance, which is not helped by the fact that that I broke my old phone and recovering the photos from my backup has been annoying without a computer. A friend of mine Alice and I are currently in Tinghir, Morocco and since Christmas we crossed the high Atlas Mountains from a small town Zaida. This part of Morocco is truly special. We’ve mostly been riding across dusty planes and through gorges with huge mountains towering up on either side of us. It’s also been water-bottles-freezing-overnight cold.  We hoped that the palm trees on the other side of the mountains would be a sign of warmer climes but although it’s been very different in many ways, I’m still typing this under the blanket with slightly frozen fingers.  People are warmer and more open. We’ve been invited into people’s houses for food and had food bought for us in a bakery. We’ve even seen women driving men on scooters and girls riding bikes on their own.  The countryside is also truly exotic. We’ve passed date-palm oases with green fields flourishing in their shade. It’s strange to see patches of abundant water after so long in the dry steppe.  We’ve had a little “trouble” with the police, who pushed us to stay in towns instead of camping a couple of times. They insist that there are bands of roaming alcoholics that will harrass us if we’re alone at night. It seems like a true case of cultural misunderstanding. They are convinced they are helping and we’re convinced we’ll be fine camping. After losing 15kg and eating like a normal human, hunger has hit me like a truck. I’m regularly ordering 2-3 main meals and enjoying the hell out of Moroccan fast food and pastries.  From here we’re heading to ouarsazatz and then to agadir, where I’ll head south towards the Sahara and Alice will head north along the coast.

More than once people stopped to offer us food along the way, with multiple women walking over to our lunch picnic and offering us bread and fruit and olive oil - such kindness and hospitality! Five minutes later some teenagers passed us making the wanking gesture at Alice - such brashness and vulgarity! Morocco really has it all. We encountered more contradictions when passing a police checkpoint in the evening a few days later. The police were quite insistent that it wasn’t safe for us and that we should stay at a guesthouse about 10km back. Of course they knew the guesthouse owner, who came and showed us pictures of the passports of other foreigners who had stayed with him to prove his legitimacy, but obviously not his respect for privacy. We managed to talk our way out of it and rode another 5km in the dark, relieved that we weren’t followed. We carefully set up camp away from the road, but then saw lights approaching. 30 minutes of frustrating charades later we relented and stayed outside somebody’s house a few kilometers away. Apparently there were roaming alcoholics everywhere and it wasn’t safe. This combination of help and concern but also paternalism was difficult to navigate. The next day we arrived in our hotel in Fes, where the owner messed up the payments and then had a full-on tantrum when we wanted to wait a day to check the bank account before paying cash. A lot of men seem to be pretty much constantly smoking hashish here. The Fes medina truly left an impression. It’s the world’s largest pedestrian zone and a full city in its own right. People live their entire lives within the walls with police stations, mosques, mini-factories, warehouses and of course retail. Tourism is present but not overwhelming, which makes it feel authentic, but not that you’re an anomaly. While in Fes, we made the decision to continue inland rather than heading to the coast. Colder and longer, but a chance to cross the Atlas mountains in their full glory. J&amp;BoB"

The gentle slope and lack of traffic meant that I could cover some big distances, while camping in abandoned train stations at night. Olive plantations dominated the landscape, even over steep rocky outcrops, as if they’d been laid in a sheet over the uneven terrain. The olive harvest was in full swing, with Landrovers and tractors whizzing between fields and towns. I’ve never seen olives being harvested before and it was fascinating. Some people still rake them off the trees by hand but there’s also a motorised machine that latches on to the trunk of the tree and violently shakes them off onto big blankets on the ground. I had one awful evening when, after a particularly big day, I hit a patch of rough clay that clogged up BoB’s wheels, even when pushed. I ended up having to carry him on one shoulder with a kilo of slippery mud clinging to each foot. When I tried to set up camp, a farmer released his dogs who barked at me while I slowly packed up camp and carried my bike a few metres at a time away from his place. After about an hour covering one kilometer, I set up camp, covered in mud. The next morning, BoB and I had a three hour spa day under a bridge and were fresh and clean again. After a quick taste of civilisation in Granada, I met up with Alice, heading south again along the coast. The road was awful, forcing cyclists to ride a sketchy highway without a real shoulder, push the bike next to the highway or to wind endlessly through golf courses and luxury resorts. After a quick stop in the UK territory of Gibraltar (you have to cross the airstrip to enter the city!), we took a few days to rest in Tarifa, with Africa beckoning us only 15km away across the straight of Gibraltar.

In the rush to the ferry I left my helmet and cap in the terminal and the captain personally apologised for not finding out earlier - an instant introduction to Moroccan hospitality. The area around the Tangier port was bustling, expensive and quite inauthentic - like a movie set erected for the benefit of day-trippers from Spain. The actors gladly earn their wages playing their sanitised, simplified and unfailingly welcoming roles. Of course, I don’t think there is anything wrong with paying for comfort. But, it’s worth noting that part of that comfort can involve glossing-over uncomfortable realities. For example, outside of these bubbles, Alice had a hard time with catcalls and casual sexism, especially from teenage boys - many of whom seem to already see themselves as above women in the pecking order. We rested for an extra day in Tangier because I had a mildly sprained ankle and then we set off first to Tetouan and Chefchaouen, known for their white and blue medinas (walled-off city centres), with a Dutch cyclist Theo. Tetouan was bustling and chaotic, especially in the Medina. Chefchaouen medina was another movie set, with little alcoves and hanging chairs set up for photos (for a price of course). The biggest factor while riding was how cold it was after sunny Tarifa. Once again we woke up with frost on our tents after bitter nights of restless sleep. Theo and another cyclist Robbie were craving some adventure, so we went for an 8km day hike to Mt. Tissouka. We’ll be there by lunchtime we thought. After missing the path to the summit, it turned into an epic mountaineering session, with rock scrambling, leopard crawling and wading through snow. After a freezing few minutes at the summit, we shivered our way down, eagle-eyed for the trail markings - often obscured by snow. We reached town again at sunset and the shower and dinner was the best of my life. A real bro bonding moment. Theo took the road to the coast and Alice and I continued inland along to Fes, the cultural capital of Morroco. J&amp;BoB"

Each European country had claimed their town - the English couldn’t live without their full breakfast with kippers and baked beans - but the layout was largely the same. Leaving Valencia was difficult to witness, there had been major flooding in the area just a few weeks prior. Although the clean-up was already underway, the destruction, dust and despair was palpable. My Hawaiian party shirt seemed garish and I changed it - very much the least I could do. We rode inland to a town called Albercete to ascape the cookie-cutter coast. The inland route was much more varied, taking us over mountains and through, orange, olive, almond pomegranite and grape plantations. The fields were full of uncollected fruit, maybe because there was nobody left to work on the fields with the flooding. In Albercete, Alice took the bus and I rode on - a chance for her to take a rest and for me to test my limits heading down to Granada. J&amp;BoB"

    ,"content"  : "Hi BoBbers, I had my first really cold night of the trip with frost on my tent in the morning and my first real hobo moment drying my tent while cooking noodles in the middle of a resort. I then had a wonderful hour-long descent down the Pyranees. No traffic and only cows to witness my joy. A fair reward for the previous three days of climbing to the peak. The real adventure started right after I had finished my descent when my back wheel suddenly locked in place - my rear rim had ruptured. I was very lucky to only be on a gentle slope rather than 60km/h downhill like literally hours before. I hitched a ride from where I was to the nearest highway and then tried to get a lift from there to the nearest town. Hours of waiting with no luck but lots of complex gestures saying that they would definitly have helped if they hadn’t just cleaned their car / I didn’t have such a threatening beard / western civilisation weren’t collapsing. I’ve heard since then that Spain is one of the most difficult countries to hitchhike in, partly because it is illegal and enforced. Luckily I contacted a host on Warmshowers who picked me up and brought me to his place (thanks Jochem!!). The next day I caught a bus into Barcelona with the help of a local bike mechanic who agressively advocated for me. Jordi doesn’t speak English and I don’t speak Spanish or Catalan, but he still sends me videos of him riding his motorbike occasionally. I spent the next week relaxing in Barcelona and got my bike fixed and wheels rebuilt at an excellent touring bike shop. I stayed with friends of friends who made my stay much more comfortable. Alice joined me in Barcelona and then it was time to head south with the new-and-improved BoB to Tarifa for the ferry across to Africa. J&amp;BoB"

    ,"content"  : "Hi BoBbers, In mid-October, with a heavy heart, I left Alice and the gang after a long rest in Morvan. I was pretty undecided, but in the end I settled on Barcelona as the next destination, a route almost entirely through the diagonal du vide, “the empty diagonal”, the least dense region of france. Luckily, I had met the lovely Marie, a friend of Alice’s. This led me on a tour of friends and friends-of-friends, little oases of company in a desert of long rides and superficial communication with my very dusty french. I did some impressive bush mechanics on a broken tent pole and rear hub, was hit on twice by middle aged men completely out of nowhere, crossed the epic Pas de Peyrol without any food and managed to get food poisoning so bad that I lay next to the road in the sun for three hours in my full kit including rain gear, until my next host drove 30km to pick me up. I also spent a surprisingly-okay night in an abandoned building on halloween night. My time in France ended with a two-day ride from Toulouse to Puigcerda, near Andorra, high up in the Pyranees and my first stop in Spain. J&amp;BoB"

Some high/low-lights We built some furniture and I learnt how to render a wall as well as about home insulation and eco friendly construction (Damien did a PhD on it). I did some work on BoB which taught me how little I know about bike maintenance. I got there in the end after weeks of frustration and prayers to Sheldon Brown. I tapered off antidepressants which left me feeling miserable and kind of anxious, despite the wonderful setting.  I learnt how to gather mushrooms. By the end of my time there I was bringing back half a kilo of mushrooms every day. All in all a relaxing and productive time. J&amp;BoB"

This part of France has some great bike paths that run next to the canals and make for super easy flat riding. This and a drink I call jungle juice (salt and mother energy drink diluted with water) allowed me to cover some big distances. On the way, I was smacked in the face with a few clichÃ©s with romantic notes written in books, rogue art installations, snails everywhere and, no joke, random wafts of the smell of cheese in the countryside. A little on the nose if you ask me. It was also interesting to see the number of abandoned buildings - this part of the french countryside is definitely struggling financially."

From Zurich I headed north to join the eurovelo 6, one of a network of long distance bike paths crisscrossing Europe. I followed it along the Rhine to Basel and the meeting point between Germany, Switzerland and France. It was mostly well signposted and smooth sailing, apart from the rain. I had my first flat next to lake Zurich, and was invited to stay in the garden of a lovely German guy who even offered me a couple of beers! Germany and Switzerland are both fascinating mixes of the old and the new, agriculture, modern cities and high tech manufacturing."

My very cheap brake pads ruptured through the rubber and carved a groove into my rim, but BoB was still moving so life was good. Also, who knew that cemeteries would be the best place to get drinking water?"

    ,"content"  : "Hi BoBbers, Munich might seem like a strange starting point for a trip through Africa (we jokingly called it “The gateway to Africa”) but there are two main reasons for having it as the launching point for my journey. Firstly, I studied there (for free!) for a couple of years and had a bunch of friends to visit - two of them even came from Prague to see me off! Secondly, Munich was the final destination of my previous motorbike trip from Australia to Germany and I’m starting to see this trip as the second leg in a three-part multi-modal world tour - motorbike, bicycle, foot and hitchhiking. But, one once-in-a-lifetime journey at a time. My goal in Munich was to catch up with friends and to get myself and the bike set up. The Munich airport is about two hours ride away from the city and I figured it would be nice to start the trip by assembling the bike and riding from the airport - this turned out to be much more difficult than I thought. My first problem was with German bureaucracy. I needed to get rid of my bike box and was pushed from one place to another because nobody wanted to deal with something even slightly out of the ordinary. I genuinely had trouble with disposing of a cardboard box in a bloody airport. One of the guys even suggested that I tear the cardboard up into little pieces and put it in the bin and told me that I didn’t understand German culture (from his accent I think he was polish and from his posture hopelessly integrated). In the end, the lady working at Subway came to the rescue, showing me the elevator to the employee-only disposal area where someone suspiciously asked me what company I worked for before reluctantly showing me the cardboard bin. The second problem I had was German design. There is a bike path that runs to the airport, but for the life of me, I couldn’t find a way to get to it. The home of Audi, Volkswagen and BMW hadn’t made it easy. After literally walking around the airport for over an hour, I caved and caught the train to the next stop, where the bike path was more accessible. The third problem I had was Australian laziness. I still didn’t have the correct tools for my pedals so I mounted them finger tight. I figured this would be enough to get me to Munich where I could find the tools and, after the ordeal I went through just to throw away a cardboard box, I didn’t want to ask around the airport for tools. Within a few kilometres I noted a slight wiggle in my right pedal, which quickly got worse - the loose pedal had stripped the aluminium thread of the crank. I was able to ride with one leg back to the train station but it wasn’t going to cover the 25km to Munich. Someone on the train showed me that it’s actually possible to mount the pedals from the back with an allen key - the first of many times that my total ignorance of bike mechanics bit me in the bum. The next two trains were delayed but finally I made it to Munich city centre. You’re not allowed to take bikes in the u-bahn, so with my newly-tightened pedal I was going to ride the 4km to the airbnb I’d booked with friends. I thought I’d quickly pump up the tyres before riding and, sweating, watched the valve core come out of the tube as I unscrewed the pump. The tube deflated. I tried again. It happened again. Third time’s a charm, right? Apparently not. I only travelled with carry-on luggage and my bike (the rest of my stuff was being brought by a friend later) so I had no tools to tighten the valve core. Sweating in earnest now, I went to the local bike-taxi guys and asked them if they had a pump I could borrow. The only pump they had didn’t have a presta connection. I tried again, this time only gently screwing on the pump. Finally, it worked and I was on the road… for about a minute. The pedal fell out again. I rode the rest of the way to the airbnb with a single pedal. After 40 hours transit, two nights sleeping in planes, two hours walking around Munich airport, two delayed trains and multiple bike breakdowns, I’d finally made it to my airbnb in Munich. My friend Alex was cycling down from Prague to Munich and the plan was for him to join me for the weekend. I was really glad to have someone to join me for the first few days, but this added a deadline to my time in Munich. Deadlines make me break out in hives but this didn’t seem to bother Alex’s hardened German heart. This made my time there a whirlwind of activity - trying to see everybody while preparing for the trip crossed the boundary from fun town to how-the-fuck-do-I-get-all-this-done land. People smile less there. I found a new crank for my bike, but it turns out that there are two kinds of connections and the one that I bought was off by 45 degrees. This meant a looong 5km walk (no bikes in the u-bahn, remember) across the city with friends from the airbnb to a friend’s place with bike and luggage in tow, stopping at every bike shop along the way hoping that they would have the correct crank, which is apparently quite rare. Just before my friend’s place, I found a bike shop which had a spare second hand hand one, which the guy gave me for 5 euros in exchange for the one I’d just bought. I also had to stop by Decathlon for a bunch of gear that I hadn’t prepared for the trip - rain jacket and pants, hiking boots, a sleeping mat (which I’d just forgotten to pack). All of these problems and my clear ignorance of the absolute basics of bike mechanics left me feeling genuinely nervous about the trip. Deep down, I knew that this was the start of a very long journey and one where I had plenty of time to learn - these would definitely not be the last mistakes that I would make along the way. But on the surface I was feeling very nervous - who was I to undertake such a big trip with so little planning? Was I really ready for something so big? How could I be so blasé about something that most people I meet consider so insurmountably difficult? It had been very easy to dismiss the planning and preparation(e.g. doing any repairs and maintenance on BoB) as something that I could do in Europe, that things would work out, that I could plan on the road. The downside of course was that I was going to feel totally incompetent while doing it. (future Jason here - after two months I’m feeling better and more capable now, don’t worry) So, my time in Munich was done and Alex was ready to go bright and early Saturday morning, bike pants crisp and shining. Two hours later when I’d finished scrambling and last-minute packing we were ready to set off on my first leg - to visit my cousins in Rapperswil, Switzerland. Some photos: BoB before unboxing outside the Munich airport. The lady at subway - literally the only helpful person that I talked to at the airport and my first helper in Munich. She showed me how to find the cardboard bin. The broken pedal and crank after a few km of riding in Europe. I think I was a bit ambitious thinking that these shoes would be able to last some time on my journey. My long suffering friends convinced me to throw them away and buy some proper boots. A pretty photo of the Munich Residenz garden. My friend Gen, on top of making the theme song for this trip, made me a fantastic send-off present that has now become my sleep shirt. It says “It is a truth universally known that a man in posession of two wheels must be in want of adventure” - a play on the opening line of Pride and Prejudice, which 90% of our friendship is based on. Not sure if you can tell, but this is the morning that I set off and I was very nervous."

    ,"content"  : "Hi BoBers, I was very lucky to find a flight across to Munich that was good for two reasons. Firstly, it was cheap and secondly, I was able to get a 16 hour stopover in Taipei - a country that I’ve heard a lot about and been wanting to visit for some time. My time there wasn’t too eventful. I arrived at 5:30am, took the train into town and roamed around the very deserted main station in Taipei before heading to the Maokong gondola which takes you up to the scenic Zhinan temple which has great views of the city. Because I have an excellent sense of misdirection, I managed to get lost walking a beautiful but overgrown footpath between two of the main gondola stops. The first random act of kindness of this trip came earlier than expected on this trip when a lovely man gestured the way to the next gondola stop, which was a five minute walk along a road before taking a turn and heading up hill. As I was walking I saw him ride past me on his scooter and as I got to the intersection I saw him there stopping traffic to let me pass and show me the way. So kind! After the gondola ride and hike I went into the city centre to find myself something to eat and managed to accidentally order a meat dish (it was the only one with tofu, I thought I was safe). In roaming around the city I came across a temple and was lucky enough to be there during a ceremony of sorts. There were a group of monks chanting in the centre of the temple and the courtyard area was full of people joining in. It was quite a moving experience. There were small offerings scattered through the courtyard area of money and water and snacks, but people were dropping and picking up small beads painted like mini watermelons. I guess everybody’s rituals can look bizarre from the outside. As the sun set I was drenched with sweat from the temperature and humidity and despite my best intentions of fully exploring the city, I went back to the air-conditioned sanctuary of the Taipei airport a few hours early and got ready for my flight to Munich and the beginning of the European leg of my journey. Any time you’re travelling in a place that is so different there’s going to be a bit of culture shock: There were really a lot of small shops filled with arcades around. Speaks for itself, I think. Air raid shelters were all over the city, clearly preparing for the worst with China. Every boy’s wish. Anyone for a pony burger? This sign was saying a lot. Powerbank rental machines were available all through the metro - a pretty good idea, I think! Taiwan seems to be quite trusting of its citizens. Not sure how long these umbrellas would last in Aus. This 7-11, however, doesn’t seem to trust its patrons very much. Even in the main station, life didn’t really start until after 9am. And finally the pretty photos:"

    ,"content"  : "As I prepared for my trip, the days leading up to my departure were an absolute frantic mess. I gave myself two days to pack up my remaining things move out and prepare the bike for my trip. As the saying (questionablyu) goes: quality, speed, sanity, pick two. I think I scraped by with one and a half. So I finished work on Wednesday and spent the following days frantically packing and organising my belongings. My goal was to sell, recycle, or donate everything I could, which actually added quite a bit more complication than just throwing some things away - who knew mattresses were so hard to give away for free? On the eve of my departure, I hosted a small farewell party with friends and following the same ritual as my last BoBbing adventure, had my head shaved to mark the beginning of my fresh streamlined self. On Saturday I managed to finally get rid of my old mattress, drop my meagre remaining belongings at my parents place and take care of my plants. My friend Gen and her good friend Nat kindly agreed to drive me and the bike to the airport and was an absolute angel, rushing to Bunnings just before it closed to grab straps for the roof racks while I did some last minute cleaning. Surprisingly, and probably because it was so deceptively simple, one of the biggest challenges was packing my bike into a bike box. The box that I had gotten from the bike store bin was just big enough but didn’t have a top, so we had to craft one out of cardboard boxes. And when one of the forks poked through the front we had only had time to tape some extra cardboard around it like a little growth around a metal splinter. The outcome wasn’t pretty but a bunch of packing tape made it very functions. The other basic step required to pack the bike is to remove the pedals. Unfortunately, I had already taken all my tools to my parents’ house and my little toolkit (rightly) didn’t have a spanner that size. I texted another angel, my neighbor, Murray, who came through with a shifting spanner just in time. I later learnt that the pedals can be turned from the back with an Allen key, which I had. Then 15 minutes to quickly crack open a bottle of champagne, shower and head off. Luckily, the bike box was a good few kgs under weight because we hadn’t had the time to weigh it before leaving. So, all in all, a pretty chaotic start to this whole travelling business. But everything was intact and I was on my way. But first an 18 hour layover in Taiwan and and a chance to explore Taipei. Some photos: I can’t remember the context here for the life of me but I think it it’ll make a great before/after photo Tradition Cheekly glass of champagne before leaving"

    ,"content"  : "So here it goes, the first post and a small step forward in starting the new adventure. There’s a certain thrill in the organising of a trip like this. Burrowing deep into the details brings a sense of control to what is by its nature a deeply uncertain endevour. The planning also sucks you into the trip before it even starts. You get to fantasise about the different scenarios that you might encounter and the people you might meet. Nevermind that you couldn’t possibly conceive of what will happen (that’s the whole point of the thing anyway, isn’t it?) and that you lack the basic experience required to imagine what really might take place. Well, I certainly do as someone that has never done a long distance bike tour and who’s only experience of Africa is South Africa and Namibia as a child. Either way, I haven’t had much time to delight in planning this trip. Partly because I’ve recently had a joint reconstruction on my thumb and I was firmly told not to touch the bike until two days before I leave. Partly because I’ve been working a lot recently trying to wrap up everything in a neat little bow before I leave. And part of it is plain old procrastination - this whole thing is so big that it’s sometimes hard to know where to the start. People (you!) are asking for a website already so this is as good a place to start as any. So, five weeks out from my leaving date BoB is laying idle with flat tyres and handlebars that are definitely too narrow to be comfortable for a long distance trip. I managed to put a big hole in my panniers (made in the 80’s before I was born) that a coworker was kind enough to donate to me. A friend at the repair cafe that I volunteer at was kind enough to hand stich a denim patch onto them for some structural support and I’m going to put a water bed patch on either side to waterproof it - hopefully it will work! I still don’t have a frame bag or front panniers. Maybe it’s because I’ve done some overlanding before or maybe it’s because I’m looking for an excuse for procrastination, but I’m really not in a hurry to fix this. I’m more interested in seeing people, party planning and wrapping up work than researching the latest gear. All power to you if that’s your thing but I think there’s a real risk of overplanning or at least overvaluing planning before the trip. The plan is essentially to start the trip in Munich with the bare minimum and use the European leg as a kind of shakedown to see what work and what doesn’t about my setup and buy and upgrade along the way anything that I need. I’m sure I’m going to curse this lack of planning at some point in the next few months, but future me always seems to have something to gripe about so I’m going to leave him to it. So there it is, the first post of a chronicle of an amazing adventure and one of the most eventful years of my life. Cheers, Jason and a slightly deflated BoB"
