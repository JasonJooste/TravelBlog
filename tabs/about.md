Hi there,

I'm Jason and I'm planning to travel from Munich to Cape Town in along the west coast of Africa, crossing from Spain to Morocco by ferry.

From 2016 to 2018 I did a similar trip by motorbike from Brisbane to Munich.
This is a kind of spiritual continuation of that trip and hopefully another leg in a Round-The-World adventure.

I'll add more here when I get a moment (a wildly inaccurate guess of my route would be cool).
