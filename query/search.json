    ,"content"  : "Hi BoBbers, Munich might seem like a strange starting point for a trip through Africa (we jokingly called it “The gateway to Africa”) but there are two main reasons for having it as the launching point for my journey. Firstly, I studied there (for free!) for a couple of years and had a bunch of friends to visit - two of them even came from Prague to see me off! Secondly, Munich was the final destination of my previous motorbike trip from Australia to Germany and I’m starting to see this trip as the second leg in a three-part multi-modal world tour - motorbike, bicycle, foot and hitchhiking. But, one once-in-a-lifetime journey at a time. My goal in Munich was to catch up with friends and to get myself and the bike set up. The Munich airport is about two hours ride away from the city and I figured it would be nice to start the trip by assembling the bike and riding from the airport - this turned out to be much more difficult than I thought. My first problem was with German bureaucracy. I needed to get rid of my bike box and was pushed from one place to another because nobody wanted to deal with something even slightly out of the ordinary. I genuinely had trouble with disposing of a cardboard box in a bloody airport. One of the guys even suggested that I tear the cardboard up into little pieces and put it in the bin and told me that I didn’t understand German culture (from his accent I think he was polish and from his posture hopelessly integrated). In the end, the lady working at Subway came to the rescue, showing me the elevator to the employee-only disposal area where someone suspiciously asked me what company I worked for before reluctantly showing me the cardboard bin. The second problem I had was German design. There is a bike path that runs to the airport, but for the life of me, I couldn’t find a way to get to it. The home of Audi, Volkswagen and BMW hadn’t made it easy. After literally walking around the airport for over an hour, I caved and caught the train to the next stop, where the bike path was more accessible. The third problem I had was Australian laziness. I still didn’t have the correct tools for my pedals so I mounted them finger tight. I figured this would be enough to get me to Munich where I could find the tools and, after the ordeal I went through just to throw away a cardboard box, I didn’t want to ask around the airport for tools. Within a few kilometres I noted a slight wiggle in my right pedal, which quickly got worse - the loose pedal had stripped the aluminium thread of the crank. I was able to ride with one leg back to the train station but it wasn’t going to cover the 25km to Munich. Someone on the train showed me that it’s actually possible to mount the pedals from the back with an allen key - the first of many times that my total ignorance of bike mechanics bit me in the bum. The next two trains were delayed but finally I made it to Munich city centre. You’re not allowed to take bikes in the u-bahn, so with my newly-tightened pedal I was going to ride the 4km to the airbnb I’d booked with friends. I thought I’d quickly pump up the tyres before riding and, sweating, watched the valve core come out of the tube as I unscrewed the pump. The tube deflated. I tried again. It happened again. Third time’s a charm, right? Apparently not. I only travelled with carry-on luggage and my bike (the rest of my stuff was being brought by a friend later) so I had no tools to tighten the valve core. Sweating in earnest now, I went to the local bike-taxi guys and asked them if they had a pump I could borrow. The only pump they had didn’t have a presta connection. I tried again, this time only gently screwing on the pump. Finally, it worked and I was on the road… for about a minute. The pedal fell out again. I rode the rest of the way to the airbnb with a single pedal. After 40 hours transit, two nights sleeping in planes, two hours walking around Munich airport, two delayed trains and multiple bike breakdowns, I’d finally made it to my airbnb in Munich. My friend Alex was cycling down from Prague to Munich and the plan was for him to join me for the weekend. I was really glad to have someone to join me for the first few days, but this added a deadline to my time in Munich. Deadlines make me break out in hives but this didn’t seem to bother Alex’s hardened German heart. This made my time there a whirlwind of activity - trying to see everybody while preparing for the trip crossed the boundary from fun town to how-the-fuck-do-I-get-all-this-done land. People smile less there. I found a new crank for my bike, but it turns out that there are two kinds of connections and the one that I bought was off by 45 degrees. This meant a looong 5km walk (no bikes in the u-bahn, remember) across the city with friends from the airbnb to a friend’s place with bike and luggage in tow, stopping at every bike shop along the way hoping that they would have the correct crank, which is apparently quite rare. Just before my friend’s place, I found a bike shop which had a spare second hand hand one, which the guy gave me for 5 euros in exchange for the one I’d just bought. I also had to stop by Decathlon for a bunch of gear that I hadn’t prepared for the trip - rain jacket and pants, hiking boots, a sleeping mat (which I’d just forgotten to pack). All of these problems and my clear ignorance of the absolute basics of bike mechanics left me feeling genuinely nervous about the trip. Deep down, I knew that this was the start of a very long journey and one where I had plenty of time to learn - these would definitely not be the last mistakes that I would make along the way. But on the surface I was feeling very nervous - who was I to undertake such a big trip with so little planning? Was I really ready for something so big? How could I be so blasé about something that most people I meet consider so insurmountably difficult? It had been very easy to dismiss the planning and preparation(e.g. doing any repairs and maintenance on BoB) as something that I could do in Europe, that things would work out, that I could plan on the road. The downside of course was that I was going to feel totally incompetent while doing it. (future Jason here - after two months I’m feeling better and more capable now, don’t worry) So, my time in Munich was done and Alex was ready to go bright and early Saturday morning, bike pants crisp and shining. Two hours later when I’d finished scrambling and last-minute packing we were ready to set off on my first leg - to visit my cousins in Rapperswil, Switzerland. Some photos: BoB before unboxing outside the Munich airport. The lady at subway - literally the only helpful person that I talked to at the airport and my first helper in Munich. She showed me how to find the cardboard bin. The broken pedal and crank after a few km of riding in Europe. I think I was a bit ambitious thinking that these shoes would be able to last some time on my journey. My long suffering friends convinced me to throw them away and buy some proper boots. A pretty photo of the Munich Residenz garden. My friend Gen, on top of making the theme song for this trip, made me a fantastic send-off present that has now become my sleep shirt. It says “It is a truth universally known that a man in posession of two wheels must be in want of adventure” - a play on the opening line of Pride and Prejudice, which 90% of our friendship is based on. Not sure if you can tell, but this is the morning that I set off and I was very nervous."

    ,"content"  : "Hi BoBers, I was very lucky to find a flight across to Munich that was good for two reasons. Firstly, it was cheap and secondly, I was able to get a 16 hour stopover in Taipei - a country that I’ve heard a lot about and been wanting to visit for some time. My time there wasn’t too eventful. I arrived at 5:30am, took the train into town and roamed around the very deserted main station in Taipei before heading to the Maokong gondola which takes you up to the scenic Zhinan temple which has great views of the city. Because I have an excellent sense of misdirection, I managed to get lost walking a beautiful but overgrown footpath between two of the main gondola stops. The first random act of kindness of this trip came earlier than expected on this trip when a lovely man gestured the way to the next gondola stop, which was a five minute walk along a road before taking a turn and heading up hill. As I was walking I saw him ride past me on his scooter and as I got to the intersection I saw him there stopping traffic to let me pass and show me the way. So kind! After the gondola ride and hike I went into the city centre to find myself something to eat and managed to accidentally order a meat dish (it was the only one with tofu, I thought I was safe). In roaming around the city I came across a temple and was lucky enough to be there during a ceremony of sorts. There were a group of monks chanting in the centre of the temple and the courtyard area was full of people joining in. It was quite a moving experience. There were small offerings scattered through the courtyard area of money and water and snacks, but people were dropping and picking up small beads painted like mini watermelons. I guess everybody’s rituals can look bizarre from the outside. As the sun set I was drenched with sweat from the temperature and humidity and despite my best intentions of fully exploring the city, I went back to the air-conditioned sanctuary of the Taipei airport a few hours early and got ready for my flight to Munich and the beginning of the European leg of my journey. Any time you’re travelling in a place that is so different there’s going to be a bit of culture shock: There were really a lot of small shops filled with arcades around. Speaks for itself, I think. Air raid shelters were all over the city, clearly preparing for the worst with China. Every boy’s wish. Anyone for a pony burger? This sign was saying a lot. Powerbank rental machines were available all through the metro - a pretty good idea, I think! Taiwan seems to be quite trusting of its citizens. Not sure how long these umbrellas would last in Aus. This 7-11, however, doesn’t seem to trust its patrons very much. Even in the main station, life didn’t really start until after 9am. And finally the pretty photos:"

    ,"content"  : "As I prepared for my trip, the days leading up to my departure were an absolute frantic mess. I gave myself two days to pack up my remaining things move out and prepare the bike for my trip. As the saying (questionablyu) goes: quality, speed, sanity, pick two. I think I scraped by with one and a half. So I finished work on Wednesday and spent the following days frantically packing and organising my belongings. My goal was to sell, recycle, or donate everything I could, which actually added quite a bit more complication than just throwing some things away - who knew mattresses were so hard to give away for free? On the eve of my departure, I hosted a small farewell party with friends and following the same ritual as my last BoBbing adventure, had my head shaved to mark the beginning of my fresh streamlined self. On Saturday I managed to finally get rid of my old mattress, drop my meagre remaining belongings at my parents place and take care of my plants. My friend Gen and her good friend Nat kindly agreed to drive me and the bike to the airport and was an absolute angel, rushing to Bunnings just before it closed to grab straps for the roof racks while I did some last minute cleaning. Surprisingly, and probably because it was so deceptively simple, one of the biggest challenges was packing my bike into a bike box. The box that I had gotten from the bike store bin was just big enough but didn’t have a top, so we had to craft one out of cardboard boxes. And when one of the forks poked through the front we had only had time to tape some extra cardboard around it like a little growth around a metal splinter. The outcome wasn’t pretty but a bunch of packing tape made it very functions. The other basic step required to pack the bike is to remove the pedals. Unfortunately, I had already taken all my tools to my parents’ house and my little toolkit (rightly) didn’t have a spanner that size. I texted another angel, my neighbor, Murray, who came through with a shifting spanner just in time. I later learnt that the pedals can be turned from the back with an Allen key, which I had. Then 15 minutes to quickly crack open a bottle of champagne, shower and head off. Luckily, the bike box was a good few kgs under weight because we hadn’t had the time to weigh it before leaving. So, all in all, a pretty chaotic start to this whole travelling business. But everything was intact and I was on my way. But first an 18 hour layover in Taiwan and and a chance to explore Taipei. Some photos: I can’t remember the context here for the life of me but I think it it’ll make a great before/after photo Tradition Cheekly glass of champagne before leaving"

    ,"content"  : "So here it goes, the first post and a small step forward in starting the new adventure. There’s a certain thrill in the organising of a trip like this. Burrowing deep into the details brings a sense of control to what is by its nature a deeply uncertain endevour. The planning also sucks you into the trip before it even starts. You get to fantasise about the different scenarios that you might encounter and the people you might meet. Nevermind that you couldn’t possibly conceive of what will happen (that’s the whole point of the thing anyway, isn’t it?) and that you lack the basic experience required to imagine what really might take place. Well, I certainly do as someone that has never done a long distance bike tour and who’s only experience of Africa is South Africa and Namibia as a child. Either way, I haven’t had much time to delight in planning this trip. Partly because I’ve recently had a joint reconstruction on my thumb and I was firmly told not to touch the bike until two days before I leave. Partly because I’ve been working a lot recently trying to wrap up everything in a neat little bow before I leave. And part of it is plain old procrastination - this whole thing is so big that it’s sometimes hard to know where to the start. People (you!) are asking for a website already so this is as good a place to start as any. So, five weeks out from my leaving date BoB is laying idle with flat tyres and handlebars that are definitely too narrow to be comfortable for a long distance trip. I managed to put a big hole in my panniers (made in the 80’s before I was born) that a coworker was kind enough to donate to me. A friend at the repair cafe that I volunteer at was kind enough to hand stich a denim patch onto them for some structural support and I’m going to put a water bed patch on either side to waterproof it - hopefully it will work! I still don’t have a frame bag or front panniers. Maybe it’s because I’ve done some overlanding before or maybe it’s because I’m looking for an excuse for procrastination, but I’m really not in a hurry to fix this. I’m more interested in seeing people, party planning and wrapping up work than researching the latest gear. All power to you if that’s your thing but I think there’s a real risk of overplanning or at least overvaluing planning before the trip. The plan is essentially to start the trip in Munich with the bare minimum and use the European leg as a kind of shakedown to see what work and what doesn’t about my setup and buy and upgrade along the way anything that I need. I’m sure I’m going to curse this lack of planning at some point in the next few months, but future me always seems to have something to gripe about so I’m going to leave him to it. So there it is, the first post of a chronicle of an amazing adventure and one of the most eventful years of my life. Cheers, Jason and a slightly deflated BoB"

    ,"content"  : "Hi there, I’m Jason and I’m riding my bike BoB (Beast of Burden) from Munich (the gateway to Africa) to Cape Town along the west coast of Africa. I travel to connect with people, and it seems like riding a bicycle is a great way to look tired and pitiable enough for people to help, as long as the smell doesn’t scare them off. I left on August 31, 2024 and my plan is to arrive before Christmas 2025. This blog is somewhat a work in progress. I stubbornly decided to make my own website with my own webserver rather than just using wordpress or something similar. This stubborn insistence on doing it myself to a fault is a central theme that I’m sure will make for great reading (at my expense) in the year to come. Any resemblence to early internet websites is unintentional and purely related to a lack of website building ability and a sense for aesthetics. Cheers, Jason and BoB"
