Hi there,

I'm Jason and I'm riding my bike BoB (Beast of Burden) from Munich (the gateway to Africa) to Cape Town along the west coast of Africa.
I travel to connect with people, and it seems like riding a bicycle is a great way to look tired and pitiable enough for people to help, as long as the smell doesn't scare them off.
I left on August 31, 2024 and my plan is to arrive before Christmas 2025.

This blog is somewhat a work in progress.
I stubbornly decided to make my own website with my own webserver rather than just using wordpress or something similar.
This stubborn insistence on doing it myself to a fault is a central theme that I'm sure will make for great reading (at my expense) in the year to come.
Any resemblence to early internet websites is unintentional and purely related to a lack of website building ability and a sense for aesthetics.

Cheers,
Jason and BoB
