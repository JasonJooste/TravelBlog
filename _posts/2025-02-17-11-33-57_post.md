Hi BoBbers,

Bag is packed and I'm ready for the 5 day circuit around and to the peak of Mt Toubkal, the highest mountain in North Africa. There are some big days with big ascents and I've rented some crampons and an ice axe just in case. I also brought all of my camping gear so the bag is slightly over packed and *heavy*. But I'm keen for the challenge and to finally get moving again. Pity BoB couldn't be here.
