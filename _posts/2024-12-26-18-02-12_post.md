I had a wonderfully relaxing time with family in Switzerland that was extended by an ankle that swelled up tennis-ball-sized out of nowhere. From Zurich I headed north to join the eurovelo 6, one of a network of long distance bike paths crisscrossing Europe. I followed it along the Rhine to Basel and the meeting point between Germany, Switzerland and France. It was mostly well signposted and smooth sailing, apart from the rain. I had my first flat next to lake Zurich, and was invited to stay in the garden of a lovely German guy who even offered me a couple of beers! Germany and Switzerland are both fascinating mixes of the old and the new, agriculture, modern cities and high tech manufacturing.
