Hi BoBers,

I was fascinated by the signs, banners and posters of Ghana and what they said about the country's underlying priorities. A good quarter of all signs were for funerals or memorials - multi-day events after 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 years. The ages of some of the deceased I can only assume were wildly exaggerated. I regularly saw funerals for people ages 120 or more. Some people I spoke to said that the focus on the dead was bankrupting them and their families.

Another quarter were for mega churches and their pastors, ranging from wholesome to apocalyptic to private-jet pyramid-scheme luxury. All of them out to convince people to join their "cross-over" sermons on new years night with diverse lessons for the new year.

The other half was general commercial fare. Little roadside street food places are called food joints, which I find awesome.

Enjoy!

Over-crossed,\
J&BoB
