My next goal was to visit my friend Alice in Morvan, a bit west of Dijon. This part of France has some great bike paths that run next to the canals and make for super easy flat riding. This and a drink I call jungle juice (salt and mother energy drink diluted with water) allowed me to cover some big distances.  On the way, I was smacked in the face with a few clichÃ©s with romantic notes written in books, rogue art installations, snails everywhere and, no joke, random wafts of the smell of cheese in the countryside. A little on the nose if you ask me. It was also interesting to see the number of abandoned buildings - this part of the french countryside is definitely struggling financially.
