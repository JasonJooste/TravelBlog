Hi BoBers,

I left Lagos in the late afternoon, keen to put even a little distance between myself and its insanity. I quickly regretted it when I found myself on an empty highway at sunset with nowhere to stay. Even after more than a year in Africa, the talk of bandits, robberies and kidnappings made me nervous. Usually, people claim the neighbouring countries are dangerous and insist theirs is different. In Nigeria, for the first time, their nationalism is always followed by a "but...".

As always, my nervousness was overblown. I found a church in a small village and stayed the night. In the morning, the pastor brought bread and chocolate milk for dipping. "Tea and bread" - a Nigerian staple. Later that day I broke a spoke. Godwin and his son gave me replacements for free. Nigerians are direct, in their requests and their kindness. I have never had so many people offer small gifts along the way. At times the attention felt oppressive. Nigeria was a good lesson in saying no.

The riding was tough. There is no decent road through to Abuja, so I cut across the countryside. It was lush and beautiful, but oppressively hot and humid, and the roads were dreadful. Conscious of my short visa, I rode long, sweaty days with little progress. I developed a sweat rash and BoB had his own collection of maladies.

Even in the countryside I passed countless checkpoints: army, vehicle inspection, police, forestry, even the navy, hundreds of kilometres from the coast. Local communities set up ad hoc checkpoints to shake down visitors. Essentially rent seeking, people said it was for the community. While taking it from other communities, of course. Luckily, as a sweaty white man on a bicycle, I was a spectacle and spared the extortion, even though I could better afford it than most. I also passed many churches and mosques, growing grander as the people grew poorer. Economically, such splendour built on the backs of the poorest on earth is a scandal. Psychologically, it makes sense. The poorer and more uncertain your life, the more religion offers a sense of control.

Towards the end of my journey I stayed with Simeon, an engineer with a master's degree getting by as a contractor. When he was younger he scraped together money for a visa and flight to Europe. On arrival he discovered the visa was fake and was sent straight home, broke. He and many others told me that without connections, work is hard to find in Nigeria. For a good government job you often have to pay a bribe of many thousands of dollars, and sometimes still do not get it. He rented a small room in a family home. The landlord's fourteen year old daughter had recently used a spare key to steal cash and building supplies from his room. I saw him in deep discussion with local police and church elders. He wanted justice, but not for her to be burned with hot irons or beaten. He did not want her arrested either, as she was the sole carer for her bedridden mother. Despite all this, he was glad to host me for the night. It is not easy in Nigeria. People say that often.

I had taken a detour to the National Museum in Esie, the first in Nigeria, where thousands of intricate soapstone figures were discovered centuries ago beneath some trees. The museum and local schools were closed due to the threat of kidnapping. The guard was alarmed by my bicycle helmet, mistaking it for a combat helmet. Once he realised I was a tourist, he called his boss, who gave me a free personal tour. I think he was glad to have something to do.

After many conversations about the safest route, I nervously set off for the capital, Abuja.

On our toes,

J&BoB
