Hi BoBers,

In Senegal, I briefly stopped by St Louis, the decaying former capital of French West Africa. The transition from the desert in Mauritania to the sometimes-green savanna of northern Senegal was massive. I saw fields of rice and vegetables. People's clothes suddenly had colour. Occasionally I would see some bare hair or a shoulder (gasp!) Senegal is still a Muslim country, but much more liberal than their northern neighbour.

I met a young German guy, Johan, who was travelling the coast at a blistering pace and we had a few speedy days to get to Dakar. I slept for a night with the rooftop goats of an alcoholic Couchsuring host before cutting off my stay and moving to a hostel for a week.

Dakar is a kind of biker's oasis on the west-coast route. It's a commercial hub and a place to rest and repair the bike - the only city with somewhat-readily-available parts for touring bikes for at least another 2,500km in Abidjan, Ivory Coast.

My front wheel had started to make a loud clicking and rumbling sound since the desert. I finally got it checked in St Louis and found the front bearings were pitted, likely because the fine desert dust had penetrated past the seal. I searched hard in Dakar for some replacements, even pulling apart the bearings of existing bikes to check them for compatibility. In the end, they were just too rare and we had to grease them and hope they would last until I could reach a care package with replacements sent to Freetown in Sierra-Leone by a long-suffering friend in Germany.

I also had a broken zip on my frame bag (rather poorly) replaced on the street for about 1.50 USD by a kid with a portable handheld sewing machine. Senegal is very serious about clothing, with even tiny villages having a dedicated tailor. Many people have tailored clothing and look really fashionable. I also had some rather fashionable front bottle racks tailor-made for BoB.

By chance I met a friend from Morocco and ended up staying with him and some friends in an apartment for another few days. We got on so well that, after a quick visit to the westernmost point of Africa, we set off south towards Gambia together.

Tailored J&BoB
