Hi BoBers,

After the Tirgit oasis, I went first to the capital city Nouakchott and then on to the border. The riding was physically challenging but simple - the goal just to survive. A lot like the life in the desert, I think. I would end the days covered in a crust of salt. Even though water is scarce, stored in giant water bladders outside of buildings, it is freely shared. So I didn't have trouble finding the enormous amounts of water I was drinking (and sweating) every day - more than 10 litres. I adapted by riding early, stopping around 12pm and resting until 4 or 5pm during the most unbearable parts of the day. Luckily, there were many low-roofed open structures around, that people used exactly for this purpose. I also learned that goats can eat cardboard - not much is wasted here.

There are some exceptions for Ramadan for travelers and for the very young, elderly and sick. But, while I was struggling to just exist in the heat, there were men working in the full sun, in long pants and long sleeves for modesty who were also fasting. Truly impressive! Also a sign that Muslim men, as well as women, have to bear a lot of discomfort in the name of religion.

In Nouakchott I stayed one night with a Ghanan guy, illegally in Mauritania, who was selling some street food. His apartment was next to an informal dump, had no plumbing and they had to carry water up and wastewater down to the ground level. He didn't go out at night, because that's when the immigration police are most active. Truly a tough guy trying hard to make things work. He and his girlfriend had a huge argument about me staying after I arrived and so I awkwardly left early the next day, despite him insisting that I stay.

There are two main border crossings between Mauritania and Senegal. I planned to cross at the calmer Diama crossing, but rode 10km past the turnoff. I decided to cross at the notoriously corrupt Rosso instead to save myself the ride back. How bad can it be, I thought?

Sandily,
J&BoB
