Hi BoBbers,

The last week has been a bit of a whirlwind of medical issues that has changed my plans quite a bit. The plan is to continue with my trip but I will need to rest in Agadir, Morocco for at least three weeks to recover.

In short, I had an abscess on my bum (not a great location for a cyclist) which I needed surgery for. The clinic was a bit of a nightmare. I was basically locked in the ward until Alice went and paid with my card. We asked what they do with people that are alone and they replied, almost confused "nobody ever comes alone". The nurses needed to be reminded about post-op antibiotics and changing my dressings.

I was in some serious pain and felt pretty trapped by the whole thing, placing my health in the hands of people that seemed pretty disinterested in actually caring for me. But, I'm healthy now, resting and slowly recovering. BoB also had a service and a clean and is fitter then ever.

The upside is that I've recovered my old photos and I now have time to document things so expect some more posts here and on the blog.

In convalescence,
J&BoB
