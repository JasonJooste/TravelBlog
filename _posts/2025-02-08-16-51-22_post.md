Hi BoBbers,

In late December, we set off to cross the Atlas mountains, which ended up being the best and most awe-inspiring part of the trip so far. We crossed vast desert steppe, dead-flat with the Atlas mountains always visible, snow-capped and towering above us. The transition to the south of the mountains was also stark - just as raw but suddenly with oases, date palms and slightly warmer weather.

We had trouble with the police again. Late one afternoon, some big storm clouds were approaching. We were already freezing cold, so we stopped to set up camp to avoid getting wet as well. A car that had been slowly following us stopped as well. Suspicious, we asked him what he wanted and he told us that we couldn't stay there and needed to continue to a guest house in the next town. Watching the sun set and knowing that arguing wouldn't bring anything, we rode another 10 km in the setting sun and through frigid rain. We negotiated with the guest house owner, who opened his guest house just for us. He was paid less than he wanted to open his entire hotel and we were forced to ride through the rain instead of just camping. Nobody was particularly happy. Apparently, alcoholics also roam these deserted plains.

We also experienced lovely hospitality again - being invited for food by a lovely woman Habiba and then by Mohammed, who invited us for a *huge* plate of couscous that we assumed was for everyone, but turned out to just be for the two of us. We ended up being a bit of a spectacle. The room filled with a bunch of elderly relatives who greeted everyone in the room individually (including us) and who insisted on me covering my sensuous knees.

After a brief stop to celebrate New Year's, Alice took the bus to the desert city of Ouarzazat and I rode to make up time. What was supposed to take 2 or 3 days instead took one. My biggest day yet, feeling totally in tune with my body and the bike. This ride awakened a ravenous hunger in me, that was only sated with literally 5 main meals for lunch the next day.

The next plan was to head to Agadir, then split up from Alice and test my fitness riding some big days south to the Mauritanian border.
