Hi BoBers,

The border crossing into the Gambia was quick and easy. Our first stop was a campground run by the incredibly open Ibrahima. He told us heartbreaking stories of the exploitation and mistreatment, first as a modern slave in the UAE then as a migrant in Algeria. We all know that it's happening, but it's totally different to see a victim in person. The worst thing is that the recruiters are Gambians who knowingly lure their countrymen into hell for a commission. Ibrahima said he would kill his recruiter if he saw him on the street. His matter-of-fact tone suggested he wasn't exaggerating.

Gambia is English-speaking and the smallest country in Africa. A narrow slice out of Senegal hugging the Gambia river. The riding was brutal. The Harmattan, the dusty, hot wind that blows south west from the Sahara, blew constantly in our faces. We battled these 45 degree winds, under dull skies grey with dust, and sweated through 35 degree nights in our tents, covered in grime. Stopping during the afternoon was no longer about comfort, but about necessity. None of our bodies were functioning properly.

The kindness we experienced made it bearable. We were invited to share food multiple times and a kind farmer let us camp under his mango trees. We woke up to a breakfast of freshly-fallen perfectly-ripe mangos. Another night, we stayed on an observation platform in the forest and chatted with an inspirational local conservationist, MJ, who was thanklessly protecting local wildlife while also supporting the local community. He casually talked about hippos breaking in and gorging on local rice paddies. As with many things in Africa, he had many ideas but resources were the main limitation.

Our final stop in Gambia was Janjanbureh/Georgetown, the site of a British settlement for freed slaves. To add a little spice, the island has a slave house and freedom tree, both dedicated to slavery that almost certainly didn't exist in the area. This lie exemplified the place,full of chancers looking for quick cash. One particularly enterprising guy gave us some mangos and got my phone number. He still texts me trying to get money for mango-tree-related injuries.
