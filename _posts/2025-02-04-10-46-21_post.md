Hi BoBbers,

Alice, BoB and I left Barcelona in late November fresh and ready to experience the southern coast of Spain. The section to Valencia turned out to be a little boring - every little town seemed to be cut from the exact same template of big square apartment blocks. Each European country had claimed their town - the English couldn't live without their full breakfast with kippers and baked beans - but the layout was largely the same.

Leaving Valencia was difficult to witness, there had been major flooding in the area just a few weeks prior. Although the clean-up was already underway, the destruction, dust and despair was palpable. My Hawaiian party shirt seemed garish and I changed it - very much the least I could do.

We rode inland to a town called Albercete to ascape the cookie-cutter coast. The inland route was much more varied, taking us over mountains and through, orange, olive, almond pomegranite and grape plantations. The fields were full of uncollected fruit, maybe because there was nobody left to work on the fields with the flooding.

In Albercete, Alice took the bus and I rode on - a chance for her to take a rest and for me to test my limits heading down to Granada.

J&BoB
