Hi BoBbers,

New year, new dependable reliable steadfast me. I'm going to try and keep this up to date from now on and I'll catch up with old stuff when I get the chance, which is not helped by the fact that that I broke my old phone and recovering the photos from my backup has been annoying without a computer.

A friend of mine Alice and I are currently in Tinghir, Morocco and since Christmas we crossed the high Atlas Mountains from a small town Zaida. This part of Morocco is truly special. We've mostly been riding across dusty planes and through gorges with huge mountains towering up on either side of us. It's also been water-bottles-freezing-overnight cold. 

We hoped that the palm trees on the other side of the mountains would be a sign of warmer climes but although it's been very different in many ways, I'm still typing this under the blanket with slightly frozen fingers. 

People are warmer and more open. We've been invited into people's houses for food and had food bought for us in a bakery. We've even seen women driving men on scooters and girls riding bikes on their own. 

The countryside is also truly exotic. We've passed date-palm oases with green fields flourishing in their shade. It's strange to see patches of abundant water after so long in the dry steppe. 

We've had a little "trouble" with the police, who pushed us to stay in towns instead of camping a couple of times. They insist that there are bands of roaming alcoholics that will harrass us if we're alone at night. It seems like a true case of cultural misunderstanding. They are convinced they are helping and we're convinced we'll be fine camping.

After losing 15kg and eating like a normal human, hunger has hit me like a truck. I'm regularly ordering 2-3 main meals and enjoying the hell out of Moroccan fast food and pastries. 

From here we're heading to ouarsazatz and then to agadir, where I'll head south towards the Sahara and Alice will head north along the coast. Frozen fingers crossed for warmer weather. 

J&BoB
