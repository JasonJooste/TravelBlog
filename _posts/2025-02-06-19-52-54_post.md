Hi BoBbers,

In early December it was finally time to start the African adventure in earnest. The ferry across to Tangier was largely uneventful. In the rush to the ferry I left my helmet and cap in the terminal and the captain personally apologised for not finding out earlier - an instant introduction to Moroccan hospitality.

The area around the Tangier port was bustling, expensive and quite inauthentic - like a movie set erected for the benefit of day-trippers from Spain. The actors gladly earn their wages playing their sanitised, simplified and unfailingly welcoming roles. Of course, I don't think there is anything wrong with paying for comfort. But, it's worth noting that part of that comfort can involve glossing-over uncomfortable realities. For example, outside of these bubbles, Alice had a hard time with catcalls and casual sexism, especially from teenage boys - many of whom seem to already see themselves as above women in the pecking order.

We rested for an extra day in Tangier because I had a mildly sprained ankle and then we set off first to Tetouan and Chefchaouen, known for their white and blue medinas (walled-off city centres), with a Dutch cyclist Theo. Tetouan was bustling and chaotic, especially in the Medina. Chefchaouen medina was another movie set, with little alcoves and hanging chairs set up for photos (for a price of course). The biggest factor while riding was how *cold* it was after sunny Tarifa. Once again we woke up with frost on our tents after bitter nights of restless sleep.

Theo and another cyclist Robbie were craving some adventure, so we went for an 8km day hike to Mt. Tissouka. We'll be there by lunchtime we thought. After missing the path to the summit, it turned into an epic mountaineering session, with rock scrambling, leopard crawling and wading through snow. After a freezing few minutes at the summit, we shivered our way down, eagle-eyed for the trail markings - often obscured by snow. We reached town again at sunset and the shower and dinner was the best of my life. A real bro bonding moment.

Theo took the road to the coast and Alice and I continued inland along to Fes, the cultural capital of Morroco.
