Hi BoBbers,

The other day I finished the most difficult physical challenge of my life. Five days of pure, grueling trek. I tapped into a reserve of teeth-gritted, stubborn, plodding mule energy that I didn't know I had. 

It's a bit of an irony that you can't stay and enjoy the summits and passes because they're too cold. At one of them I found my water bottle half frozen and couldn't even bear taking off my gloves for a picture. I also used an ice axe and crampons for the first time which made me feel like a real mountaineer. 

On the final day, we woke up at 4am for the summit at sunrise and then a 2400 metre decent to the starting point, Imlil. 

So here I am at the end, fingertips still tingling from the cold exposure, blisters on every toe, one toenail cracked and the other detached from kicking footholds in the snow. It was a huge endeavour and I'm completely spent.

I just reached the coast and BoB. My visa is running out and I'm not fully recovered yet, so I will need to catch the (22 hour!) bus down to Dakhla and then finally leave Morocco after almost three months for the next country: Mauritania!

Newly reunited,

J&BoB
