Hi BoBers,

It's reaching that part of the trip where parts (mine and BoB's) are starting to break. Almost no gear is designed for this kind of continuous use, sweat and oil/lack of oil. It's reached a point where the ever-extending to-do list is getting annoying. I hope to have more time to rest and truly decimate this bloody list in Ivory Coast.  The little spots are scabies bites and a COW ATE MY SHIRT.

Don't scroll to the end if you're eating or have a weak stomach.

NOTE:
Telling the difficult parts on Instagram in ANY more detail than "I conquered many manly mountains to set free my inner millionaire misogynist alpha wolf" or "I'm finally living my best life after overcoming my toxic relationships with my friends, family, religion and facts" seems to make some people think I'm suffering and crying for help. I know it's not particularly normal for social media and that's why it stands out like a sore toe but I'M FINE! I'm just trying to tell the whole story for honesty's beleaguered sake. I think it makes the good parts seem more real, don't you?

Burdened but not overburdened,

J&BoB
