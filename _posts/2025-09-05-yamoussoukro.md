Hi BoBers,

This one will be a little different. I'm trying to put write more here on the blog and leave the pretty pictures for the other social media. I'm sure a bunch of people were just liking in solidarity and leaving it at that. And so I'm free of Insta's character limit. It was a good way to keep things succinct though, so let's hope I don't go overboard.

Today I visited the Basilique de Notre Dame de la Paix {CHECK}. It left such an impression on me that I wanted to write about it in a bit more detail. It seems emblematic of what Yamoussoukro, the tiny political capital of Ivory Coast, represents. A monument to short-sighted big construction. To hubris. To self-centredness. I chose to visit this city for exactly this reason.

{SOME HISTORY}

The surrounds were surprisingly rough. I expected this to be a rich part of a rich city, but there are dirt roads and roadside restaurants up to the large, white fences surrounding the dry lawns surrounding the towering building. I paid 5000 CFA to enter. That's about 7.5USD or 20 decent meals of fish and rice. The cafe sold n'espresso coffee. Aluminium-wrapped, imported and designed to conveniently imitate an espresso, in a country drowning in excellent coffee, at 10 times the price.

The building is imposing. I guess that's the point. You're supposed to fear God. Be in awe. Huge columns that would take at least four hippies turned wall-street bankers to hug. I got to the entrance and tried to wander inside, but was stopped. I needed to join a tour guide.

The tour guide was good at her job. She knew the lines where people would laugh and gave them pauses. She made a dry by-heart script sound novel. All facts and figures and dates. 7 chapels (the four closest were fenced-off and filled with bricks). 4 clocks. 114kg per clock. Did you know, they're made of bronze and came all the way from France?! How else could you describe a place so dry and artificial by nature? But she was a deft hand, adding tone to static, colour to a bland canvas. An actress rescuing a terrible script through sheer force of will.

We proceeded towards the centre of the Basilica in fits and starts. Stocatto. Never a moment to breathe or appreciate. Facts. 7000 seats. Space for 11,000 more outside. Fired at us spitfire. Venez avec moi (*come with me*), venez avec moi, venez avec moi. Each time, she takes a few steps forward to her next spot. I can't imagine how many times she's stood on that exact spot and said those exact words and gotten those exact polite laughs. There's a French woman with a guide. The only other white person that I saw today. She was nodding, attentive. A good student. A notebook, neatly organised, highlighted and underlined.

Luckily, there are people here to moisten these dry proceedings. We received one instruction upon entering: no video. Apparently, it makes the place look bad on social media. No mention of God anywhere there. A man with airpods in his ears, immediately ignore this and is scolded by a guide. He sneakily takes a photo while the guide isn't looking. A woman hangs back to get a clip of herself in the President's assigned seat. Another dunks a plastic cup into the brutalist baptism {{basin}}, quickly gulping down some holy water.

The interior is breathtaking. The room is circular, with the towering walls dominated by huge stained glass windows. They're ornate and cast intricate, soft shadows (images?) throughout. As an atheist, sometimes it bothers me that I only get this feeling of awe and humbleness in huge religious monuments like this. And as a human being that cares about human beings, it bothers me that they're always so huge and expensive. The bigger the better, it seems, when it comes to feeling spiritual. Totally at odds with their many ascetic teachings. {EXAMPLES}

On display was both a prayer to and a prayer from Pope Jean Paul the 2nd. He consecrated {TRUE?} the building in 1990 {TRUE?}. I'm sure there are many things he had to bite his tongue over in the past, but I have no idea how he could give his blessing to such an ostentatious building {BETTER?} in such a poor country. Proof of its uselessness: there was two men on their phones and two tourist groups in the vast space. How might these resources have been spent?

After the tour was over everyone went around taking videos. The guide went outside, apathetic. I had a chance to sit and reflect, a reprieve from the fully-automatic factoid fire. Nothing religious, but you can't help but think about your life and future in a place like this. Then I went out into the courtyard and grounds to take some photos. There was fruiting orange trees. Thankfully, I think Ivory Coast is the kind of place where the staff might take them home. There were none on the ground. The courtyard was covered in cracks already, stained with the rust of some wire that had clearly been lying there for some time. It seemed nobody visited these vast grounds.

I'm not sure I have a moral to this story. Since time immemorial, humans have been spending ungodly resources on religious monuments. Sometimes through sheer pride and a desire to show off. But also through genuine religious conviction. I think we figured out that it doesn't mean much unless someone suffered for it. And people certainly suffered for this place.
